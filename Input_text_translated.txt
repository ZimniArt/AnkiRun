Chapter 2
Shovel Knight / Verbs
DOI: 10.1201/9781003346586-2

Shovel Knight is a great игра.
Shovel Knight came out in 2014 when indie игры were just becoming a
thing. Shovel Knight is a great example of the retro movement, where
игры are created to honor the classic игры of old. Shovel Knight evokes
the feel of old-school 2D platforms like Super Mario Bros or Castlevania
but also adds its own unique twists.
This dissection is specific to Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope, the original
игра in the series (Figure 2.1). Sequels and spinoffs usually require their
own dissections, even if some aspects may be the same.

Shovel Knight: Gameplay Dissection
Verbs
To understand a игра, the best place to start is the verbs. What actions может
the игрок take?
Games are different from other forms of entertainment like books and
movies. The biggest difference is что in игры, the игрок gets to do things.
The игрок может change what happens in the experience through their choices
and other actions. When ты’re reading Hamlet (Shakespeare 1604), это’s
always going to end the same way, and Hamlet’s always going to drag his
feet to get there. When ты’re playing a игра of Go with a friend, ты
don’t know who’s going to win or how они’re going to do это. That
combination of agency and uncertainty is what makes игры fun. Games
are interactive.
So, when ты’re trying to understand a игра, start with questions about
interactivity. What does the игрок do? What actions может the игрок take?
There’s more to understand than just что, but это’s a good place to start.
In Shovel Knight, the игрок может move around and hit things with a
shovel. Movement is a combination of running and jumping. The core
gameplay is Run, Jump, and Attack. The игрок может complete 90% of the
игра by just doing these three things. These are the core actions of этот
игра.
But how do we know что? Let’s dig a little deeper.

Advanced Verb-ing
One theme throughout этот book is что игра dissections depend on your
goals как a dissector. If ты’re just trying to get a rough understanding of
Shovel Knight, understanding что the игрок’s actions are Run, Jump, and

Attack is enough. Stop there, move on. That’s a completely valid approach
and ты может pat yourself on the back.
But sometimes ты need to know more. If ты’re going to start work on
the a 2d platformer team, or ты’re going to make a игра inspired by
Shovel Knight, or ты’re writing a dissertation on это, ты need to understand
игрок actions at a deeper level.
And sometimes the verbs may not be как obvious. If ты’re not sure what
counts как a core action, ты may need to spend a little more time analyzing
before ты может say что with authority.
When ты’re doing a deep analysis of a new игра, это’s useful to start
with every verb ты может think of. Go through the controller diagram. Think
about what ты do when ты play the игра, especially the choices что ты
deliberate over. Ask your friends “What do ты do in этот игра?” Read the
wiki if there is one. Write это all down как a starting point.
Let’s do что for Shovel Knight:
Run
Run Right (right on the controller while on the ground)
Run Left (left on the controller while on the ground)
Attack (press the attack button, officially called “Dig Slash”)
Jump (jump button while on the ground)
Jump Right (jump button while moving right)
Jump Left (jump button while moving left)
Fall (what happens after ты jump or are in the air for another reason)
Air Control (moving right/left while in the air)
Drop Attack (a combination of falling and attacking triggered by
pressing down while in the air, officially called “Shovel Drop”)
Dodge (move or jump to avoid an enemy or other hazard)

Fight (move and attack against an enemy, with a combination of
different actions mixed together)
Boss Fight (fight, but with more complicated things going on)
Wait (don’t do anything, sometimes important to get timing right)
Dig (attack a pile of dirt to get things out of это)
Break (attack an object like a chest or wall to destroy это)
Loot (technically pulling things out of a chest is a different action than
breaking the chest open)
Juggle (hit something что is falling, which sends это up again)
Die (lose health or fall in a pit)
Talk (press up while near a Non-Player Character (NPC) to initiate
dialog)
Buy (choose a text option to spend money or otherwise acquire a
thing)
Fish (use an inventory item to try to get stuff)
Use Relic (use an inventory item at the cost of Magic, with about a
dozen different ones что может be acquired)
Drink (use an inventory item to gain a bonus)
Play Music (select music via a conversation with an NPC)
Charge Slash (a modified attack earned later in the игра)
Uncover (sometimes when ты destroy something, there is another
object or enemy behind это что enters the scene)
Mini-Game (there are places where ты может play little sub-игры with
different goals)
Explore (look around and move around to find something new)
Find (basically the same как Explore, but possibly referring to a specific
thing ты were looking for)

Gather (pick up coins or other things, which happens naturally when
the character touches them)
Collect (usually used to mean the same thing как Gather but может also
refer to Feats or other more abstract things)
Plan (connect a series of actions in your mind and think about using
them together, possibly with specific timing)
Position (place yourself in the right place)
Observe (watch how the objects in the world work)
Learn (uncover the systems of the игра and how они work)
Predict (use what ты’ve learned to come up with a theory about what
will happen next)
Watch (cut scenes)
Travel (move on the map view что is used to select level)
Showdown (a separate play mode что я’m ignoring for этот dissection)
Challenge Mode (another separate play mode)
New Game (UI action to start a игра)
Enter Name (UI action to label a игра save)
Body Swap (change avatar appearance)
You может see how этот list может get pretty long. Let’s talk about how to turn
этот big list into a smaller list что is more useful.
To start, let’s analyze these words. Which verbs relate to each other?
Which do ты think of together when ты’re playing?

Pre-Verbs
If ты’re dissecting an idea for a new игра ты’re thinking about, ты won’t have a controller
diagram to get ты started. Instead, ты need to identify the verbs based on the information ты
do have.
When ты’re describing the idea to people, what actions do ты talk about?
When ты play the игра in your head, what is это что ты’re doing?
Picture the игра on a controller. What would the buttons do?
This might be hard. The inspiration for a игра idea может start with a story or a cool new feature
or other things. But if ты find что your игра idea doesn’t have clear verbs, что’s a sign что
your idea isn’t really complete yet.
Understanding the core loop is a key part of early ideation. You может’t pitch a игра if ты
может’t describe what the игрок is going to actually do in что игра. If этот happens, ты need to
spend some more time thinking этот through before moving on.

Direct Action Verbs
Since we’re trying to understand interactivity, we want to focus on verbs
что are about the игрок directly doing something. Look for verbs where the
игрок does something что sends input to the computer – этот может be
pressing a button, pushing on a stick, touching a touchpad, or anything else.
When the игрок does этот, the игра responds. The игра rules recognize
the игрок’s action как something important, and something in the игра’s
model of the world changes (Figure 2.2). These are key to interactivity.

Figure 2.2 Flow chart showing how the игрок does something,
foreshadowing bigger flow charts coming up soon.
Once we identify things the игрок может do, we может look for verbs что all
relate to the same type of action. Any игрок actions что result in the same
response from the игра может be grouped together. That’s what we’re looking
for.
Looking over the big list, we может group a bunch of movement-related
verbs together. All of these are used by the игрок to change the position of
their avatar character.
Run
Run Right (right on the controller while on the ground)
Run Left (left on the controller while on the ground)
Jump (jump button while on the ground)
Jump Right (jump button while moving right)
Jump Left (jump button while moving left)
Air Control (moving right/left while in the air)
The important thing here is to recognize что the игрок controls an avatar in
a 2D space by changing the avatar’s position (and orientation) in the world.
There are a lot of different movement controls with slight nuanced
differences. The diversity of specific movement controls is a good sign что
navigating through the world is important in этот игра.
Each of these is important to understand if ты’re really trying to dig
deep on how Shovel Knight works. Doubly so for other игры with more
complex controls to navigate more complex 3D scenes. But for right now,
we может group them all together как “Move”. We’ll talk about more ways to
differentiate these types of overlapping verbs later.

Deeper Dives: Research
When я start working on a игра что fits into an existing genre or has a clear relationship with
another игра, это’s important to start by doing a deep analysis of что related игра.
Play the игра thoroughly yourself and reflect on the experience.
Play related игры.
Watch other people play the игра. Social media может be great for этот.
If это happens to be a игра with an active fandom, read up on what они think. Try to build
the knowledge что a fan would have. There will always be fans with deeper knowledge
than ты – some fans are great with details – and что’s OK.

The next set of verbs is combat related:
Attack (press the attack button, officially called “Dig Slash”)
Drop Attack (a combination of falling and attacking triggered by
pressing down while in the air, officially called “Shovel Drop”)
Charge Slash (a modified attack earned later in the игра)
Dodge (move or jump to avoid an enemy or other hazard)
Fight (move and attack against an enemy, with a combination of
different actions mixed together)
Boss Fight (fight, but with more complicated things going on)
There are lots of ways to inflict damage on enemies. The игрок provides an
input and then the игра rules decide if an enemy takes damage and how
much. я think we может comfortably group these verbs together and talk about
“Attack” как one of the big concepts in Shovel Knight.
The final set of direct игрок actions are all object-related. The игрок has
an inventory of special actions они может take (by pressing up and attack).
There are about a dozen different Relics the игрок может acquire over the
course of the игра with various different effects, ranging from healing to

attacks to earning money. Most of these deplete the игрок’s Magic stat
when used.
Use Relic (use an inventory item at the cost of Magic, with about a
dozen different ones что может be acquired)

Indirect Action Verbs
Action Verbs что describe what the игрок может do are the most important
for understanding the core of a игра, but there are a variety of other verbs
что happen during a игра что are important to understand.
Die (lose health or fall in a pit)
Gather (pick up coins or other things, which happens naturally when
the character touches them)
Collect (usually used to mean the same thing как Gather, but может also
refer to Feats or other more abstract things)
Uncover (sometimes when ты destroy something, there is another
object or enemy behind это что enters the scene)
There are verbs что happen in the игра but are not directly triggered by the
игрок. These are more of a consequence of a игрок action than the action
itself. The игрок never presses “Collect” in Shovel Knight – они just walk
over to an object and if это’s the right type of object, like a gem, это just gets
collected. The игрок might do что intentionally, but the “do” the игрок
does is just movement.
There are also object actions the игрок может take based on the items in the
world around them. These use the existing controls but change the results
based on the objects in the world when the игрок performs their action.
These are important to understand but are less core than the actions.

Talk (press up while near an NPC to initiate dialog)
Fall (what happens after ты jump or are in the air for another reason)
Dig (attack a pile of dirt to get things out of это)
Break (attack an object like a chest or wall to destroy это)
Juggle (hit something что ты’ve previously hit to keep это in the air)
Buy (choose a text option to spend money or otherwise acquire a
thing)
Play Music (select music via a conversation with an NPC)
Loot (technically pulling things out of a chest is a different action than
breaking the chest open)
The most common type of object interaction is talking with NPCs. я know
это’s a bit rude to call NPCs objects, but from the perspective of the code
there’s not much difference.
Technically ты could call combat an indirect action because это only
makes sense if there’s an enemy nearby and there isn’t always an enemy
nearby. This is a clever point, but given the frequency of enemies in the
level design, я think это’s fair to call “Attack” a core gameplay action. If
someone re-made Shovel Knight with significantly fewer enemies and more
depth to the NPC interactions, это would be an interesting way to make an
entirely different игра in a different genre without changing the core
engine or code or игрок actions of Shovel Knight. But это wouldn’t be Shovel
Knight. More on content and how это changes the игра in a later chapter.

Abstract Verbs
Dodge (move or jump to avoid an enemy or other hazards)
Explore (find something new)

Find (basically the same как Explore, but possibly referring to a specific
thing ты were looking for)
Plan (connect a series of actions in your mind and think about using
them together, possibly with specific timing)
Position (place yourself in the right place)
Observe (watch how the objects in the world work)
Learn (uncover the systems of the игра and how они work)
Predict (use what ты’ve learned to come up with a theory about what
will happen next)
Mini-Game (there are places where ты может play little sub-игры with
different goals)
There are a number of potential verbs we identified что aren’t things the
игрок может do. These are things the игрок thinks about when doing other
things – these are why the игрок does things, not what the игрок does. So,
these are important to consider, but я would categorize these как goals, not
actions. These are incredibly important to understand and are fundamental
to understanding the core игра loop, but я’d put them in a different
category than direct игрок actions, and we’ll cover them in a later chapter.

Interface Verbs
Watch (cut scenes)
Travel (move on the map view что is used to select level)
Showdown (a separate play mode что я’m mostly ignoring for этот
dissection)
Challenge Mode (another separate play mode)
New Game (UI action to start a игра)
Enter Name (UI action to label a игра save)

Body Swap (change avatar appearance)
There are a number of actions что the игрок takes entirely in the UI (User
Interface), outside of core gameplay. In a игра like Shovel Knight, это’s easy
to distinguish when the игрок is controlling an avatar (Shovel Knight) in
the игра world versus when the игрок is selecting words in a menu. The
UI is something outside the illusion of the игра, which is necessary but not
part of the fun. If ты’re working on designing the UI, definitely think these
through and consider all the options. But for этот игра, они are not core
gameplay.

Deeper Dives: Frame by Frame
For fast-paced игры, one technique я find very useful is to record a short video of the core
gameplay, then step through the video frame by frame. Watch closely, and ты’ll see lots of little
things что the developer does to make things work. Visual effects что communicate important
information to the игрок, little tricks of physics to make things flow better, and complex camera
behaviors so the игрок’s attention is on the right things. These are great when ты need to know
everything about a игра. But most of этот chapter is for when ты’re just starting to understand
a игра.

Games как Input/Output
To help understand why these different types of verbs are different, let’s talk
about how игры work. As with most things, игры может be understood in a
lot of ways. This is one of those ways.
When a игрок plays a video игра, они are participating in an exchange
with a computer. The игрок provides inputs through a device of some sort –
a игра controller, a keyboard, a touch screen – and the computer processes
что inputs and then provides an output for the игрок – pixels on a screen.
The computer uses a set of rules and logic and code to determine how the
игрок’s input changes the pixels. The rules and logic and code are what the

игра designer controls. That is what we call the игра. But everything else
is important to understand как это creates the full experience.
This может be represented in a diagram like Figure 2.3.

Figure 2.3 Input Output.
The left side of этот image represents the игрок. What они see, what они
think, what они do. The right side of этот image represents the computer.
All the electrical impulses tickle the microchips based on the code of the
игра.
Let’s step through a simple single-игра action based on этот model. The
игрок is enjoying a pleasant time in Shovel Knight (Figure 2.4). They
notice some gems above and to the left, so они decide to jump to gather
them.

Figure 2.4 Shovel Knight игра screen showing the moment
before the игрок makes a decision.
We start by noting что the игрок has made a decision (Figure 2.5). This
is how things start in игры – things happen in the игрок’s brain. The root
of all gameplay is imagination.

Figure 2.5 я want to jump.

In order for the игра to do anything, этот thought needs to get from the
игрок’s brain to the computer (Figure 2.6). There are all sorts of useful
input devices designed to make этот happen. The nature of the input device
has a large impact on the игрок’s experience, and new types of input
devices like the iPhone’s touch screen or the Wii’s motion controller может
lead to huge changes in the video игра industry.

Figure 2.6 Press the button.
For our current discussion, это doesn’t really matter what input device is
being used. The important thing is что the игрок presses a button on the PC
or игра controller что indicates что the игрок wants the character (Shovel
Knight) to jump.
This information then flows into the computer (Figure 2.7). A series of
electrical impulses flow from the controller through a wire into the
computer, where chips translate the signals into the code.

Figure 2.7 Electrons flow.
The code then processes the new information (Figure 2.8). The code
knows что этот sequence of electrical impulses means что этот button was
pressed. And этот button means jumping. And jumping means many things:
The position of the avatar character changes, moving them upward.
Most игры have a physics engine что controls positions and motion,
so этот is done by adding a force in a direction to the character and
letting the physics logic compute the exact change in position.
Because of the physics engine, gravity starts operating on the
character, changing their motion over time.
The character’s animation changes from a standing animation to a
jumping animation.
This changes the character’s state – the character is now in the air.
Now different inputs and outputs are possible. If the игрок presses
down now, the character will go into a downward attack state, как
defined by the игра rules written into the code. Pressing the jump
button again won’t do anything.

And all of этот needs to be reflected in the pixels on the screen.

Figure 2.8 Character enters jump state.
This last point is important. The state changes in the code only matter if
the игрок может understand them. Most video игры может only communicate
their internal changes through a screen. Any change to the internal state and
logic of the игра needs to be expressed in pixels so the игрок может process
это (Figure 2.9). Setting up the right pixels is a combination of игра art to
reflect changes in the игра world and UI/UX design to reflect changes in
the data presented by the игра. Both are important and ideally both work
together to produce the best result.

Figure 2.9 Pixels change.
The игрок has their own complex system of input devices что они use
to process incoming information – eyes, ears, noses, etc. Good игры will
reinforce their messages using как many senses как possible (Figure 2.10).
Starting with visual, often using audio, and occasionally adding some
vibration so the игрок может feel what is happening. Smell and taste don’t
come up как often, but я’m sure smell-o-vision will be everywhere in a few
years.

Figure 2.10 Player notices change.
And then the cycle begins anew. Once the игрок processes этот new
information, они want new things (Figure 2.11). For example, что frog
might be a problem, so the игрок may need to change their direction or
enter an attack state to avoid taking damage (Figure 2.12). The full игра
experience is a long sequence of very quick input/output cycles что add up
to create something greater than each part.

Figure 2.11 Player wants new thing.

Figure 2.12 Screenshot of Shovel Knight, showing a jump has
begun.

Verbed Input/Output
This Input/Output flow gives us a way to understand the differences in
different types of verbs. Each verb operates on a specific step of the
diagram как seen in Figure 2.13.

Figure 2.13 Input verbs and output goals.
The Direct Action verbs are controller inputs delivered by the игрок.
The Indirect Action verbs are things что happen in the computer based
on the игрок actions.
The Abstract verbs are going on in the игрок’s head, helping them
plan out their next action but not happening как a direct result of a
controller input.
Interface verbs affect things the игрок sees in the Game Display что
are not part of the игра world.
This helps explain why the Direct Action verbs are the most important for
an initial understanding of the игра. They are the simplest and most clear
actions что shape the range of options for everything else. They are where
the игрок что exists in the real world interacts with the игра. The игра
rules only decide to break things after the игрок uses the attack action. And
the игрок’s desires are similarly shaped by the range of inputs the игра
allows. The игрок may want to build a bridge or get a drink at the bar but
without a related button что desire is going to go unfulfilled.

The actions the игрок может take shape everything about the игра. So,
start there if ты want to understand the игра.

Understanding Verbs
Verbs are just the first step.
If Shovel Knight is about Moving and Attacking, so is Halo (2001). So is
Super Mario Bros (1985). So is God of War (2005). But these are all very
different игры.
The second step in a игра dissection is to understand the nature of the
verbs and how они fit together. We’ll talk more about systems later, but the
core ideas of systems thinking is что the relationships between things (in
этот case verbs) может be как complex and interesting как the things themselves.
So, let’s start with our two core verbs.

Overlapping Verbs with Different Rules
So, we’ve broken Shovel Knight into the Core Verbs of “Move” and
“Attack” but want to understand more about them.
Going back to our definition of игры in the first chapter может help. We’ve
already covered Interactivity – the choices and skills что make up the Big
Verbs. Next on the list is Rules.
So, our Verbs are what the игрок может do. The Rules are how the игра
responds to those prompts from the игрок (Figure 2.14). “When the игрок
does X, the игра does Y”

Figure 2.14 Outputs.
In a board игра, these are written out explicitly. “When ты pass GO,
collect $200”. A core verb in Monopoly (1935) is move, so “pass GO” is
something что может happen naturally как a result of the игрок’s action.
The same sort of thing happens in a video игра like Shovel Knight.
When ты touch an enemy, ты lose health. When ты walk over a health
pack, there are fewer health packs in the level and ты have more health.
The игрок does something, and the игра responds.
Moving in Shovel Knight is about position, and position interacts with a
lot of игра rules.
Where ты are relative to an enemy determines whether or not ты get
hit by an enemy attack.
Where ты are and where ты’re pointing determines if your attack
hits the enemy when ты trigger an attack.
Where ты are determines when ты pick up gems, powerups, or other
items.
Where ты are determines what ты может see – the игра only shows
ты one screen at a time, based on игрок position.

Where ты are triggers progression through levels, including triggering
cut scenes что advance the story.
This is similar in a 3D first-person shooter but with some important
differences:
Where ты are determines whether or not ты get hit by an enemy
attack.
Where ты are and where ты’re pointing determines if your attack
hits the enemy.
Where ты are determines when ты pick up ammo, weapons,
powerups, or other items.
Where ты are and where ты’re pointing determines what ты может
see, using a first-person perspective.
Where ты are triggers progression through levels, including triggering
cut scenes что advance the story.
So, one way ты может differentiate similar verbs is by looking at the rules
and consequences of those verbs. When there are mechanic differences,
those are indicators что the verbs may sound the same but are functionally
very different.

Overlapping Verbs with Different Goals
Looking at how verbs interact with rules is helpful. The processes going on
in the computer может change how the verbs work. But the processes going on
in the игрок’s head are even more important.
Why does the игрок use verbs?
Verbs are used to achieve goals.

Verbs only mean something in the context of the игрок’s goals.
What are the игрок’s goals in Shovel Knight? Let’s do a quick brainstorm
like we did for verbs.
Rescue Shield Knight.
Help the characters ты meet.
Defeat enemies.
Reach the end of the level.
Trigger the next cut scene.
Unlock new areas.
Get to the end of the игра.
Don’t die.
Some of these (“Rescue Shield Knight” and “Help the characters ты
meet”) are story, not gameplay. Story is an important part of most игры,
but when we’re still assembling a core loop, это’s not the most important
thing to understand. Story motivates players to complete the игра, это
doesn’t motivate the players’ actions from moment to moment. At least for
a игра like этот – some игры like Baldur’s Gate (1998) or Life Is Strange
(2015) make story a key part of every level of gameplay. But a игра like
Shovel Knight does not weave the story into every moment of gameplay
like этот.
The goals что are woven into every moment of gameplay are the ones
like “Defeat enemies” or “Reach the end of the level” что guide игрок
actions in every moment. This is what the игрок is trying to do during
gameplay, and этот is why the игрок engages with the verbs of the игра.
The игрок attacks to defeat enemies and moves to reach the end of the
level.

The next few goals (“Trigger the next cut scene”, “Unlock new areas”,
and “Get to the end of the игра”) are just “Beat the level” phrased slightly
differently. When ты’re considering goals or verbs, keep an eye out for
overlapping terms like этот.
The final objective “Don’t die” isn’t really a goal per se but is more of a
fail case. If the игрок dies, они have to reset a little ways back. Death
never stops ты from progressing, but это может definitely slow ты down.

Verb to the Goal
So how does the игрок turn “Move” and “Attack” into completed levels?
They move through the level to find a route что gets to the next area while
avoiding or attacking any threats. Most areas have a little challenge or
puzzle to advance. Some areas require jumping over pits. Some require
jumping off objects to get up high. Each area has a different combination of
challenges что makes это interesting and different. More on что later.

Big Verbs
OK, so we’ve defined the big verbs in Shovel Knight как Move and Attack.
That feels right. When я play the игра, я spend most of my time doing
those things. And thinking about those two things and how to do them
better.
If ты want to understand a игра, understand the things the игрок
spends most of their time doing. Sometimes there are other features что are
splashy and interesting and become the focus of the marketing and
discussion around the игра. But a игра designer needs to think about the
thing the игрок is actually investing their time on.

You может see этот in lots of different types of игры. Platformers spend a
lot of time perfecting their jumping and running. In an open world игра,
ты spend most of your time moving from place to place. The open world
игры что succeed are the ones что этот travel fun and engaging.

Verb как Genre
As we’ll see in future chapters, verbs are a good way to differentiate and organize игры. All
first-person shooters start with move and attack. Platformers like Mario focus heavily on move,
with varying amounts of attack depending on the platformer.
But a игра like SimCity doesn’t have move как a verb at all – the primary verb there is build.
This makes sense – я think most people would agree что platformers have more overlap with
shooters than with builders.
This может be useful to know. If ты’re looking for inspiration on your city builder, это might not
be best to start by playing some Halo. Maybe find a puzzle игра like Triple Town что shares
“Build” как a verb to see how это’s done differently there.

More to Come
We’re going to stop our Shovel Knight gameplay analysis here. я know
we’ve barely scratched the surface of Shovel Knight and platformers in
general. But we’re building foundations here. It’ll get crazier in later
chapters.
The last part of этот analysis pulls some ideas from future chapters, but я
like showing a version of the same diagram for each игра, so forgive me
for the spoilers. This diagram represents each игра как a formula. The
игрок has verbs они может use to reach goals but are blocked by challenges.
Figure 2.15 shows the simplest level of detail, breaking each step into a
single element. Figure 2.16 is a bit more useful in что это breaks each of
these categories into multiple entries, showing the different actions and
challenges of the игра:

Figure 2.15 Shovel Knight flow diagram showing Verbs,
Challenges, and Goals.

Figure 2.16 Shovel Knight flow diagram with more boxes.
Each level is a package of these different pieces, как shown in Figure 2.17.
In Shovel Knight, most of the variation comes from changing out the
challenges, but other игры может handle этот differently.

Figure 2.17 Shovel Knight flow как a level.
Multiple levels может be added together to represent the full flow of the
игра, как players work on larger goals and larger challenges. See Figure
2.18.

Figure 2.18 Shovel Knight flow from level to level.
We’ll dig into these ideas in more detail in later chapters, but before we
leave Shovel Knight, let’s talk about other things что influence gameplay.

Shovel Knight: Non-Gameplay Dissection
When dissecting, это’s not just about gameplay. Even for a игра designer.
If ты want to understand the gameplay of a игра, ты have to
understand everything about это. How do the non-gameplay aspects of the
игра tie into the gameplay? Where did the gameplay ideas come from?
What led to the gameplay decisions ты see in the игра? The игра itself
makes much more sense if ты understand the context что led to those
decisions.
To be clear, я did not work on (most of) the игры я talk about in этот
book. я do not know how decisions were made by the teams что did. We’re
talking about these things как an outsider, piecing things together from what
we может see in the игра and generally available knowledge. я’m sure there
are interesting stories there, and я encourage those who were present to
write them down so я может read those books. я love to know authorial intent,
but unless что’s ты, the rest of us are left with the work itself. And there’s
plenty to see there.

Senses
Gameplay is influenced by the look and feel of the игра.
Shovel Knight has a very clear and distinct style. It’s a retro игра trying
to emulate the feel and visuals and sounds and complete experience of a
classic platformer. In этот sense, the style fits very clearly with the
gameplay. People who are familiar with the references will expect the
gameplay and style to both align with their perception of those earlier
игры. And people who don’t know the classics will still understand что
both gameplay and style evoke an earlier age, so don’t expect integrated AI
and vast open worlds and high-fidelity graphics.

The simplicity of the игра also makes это easy to see where gameplay and
graphics intersect. Remember our input/output diagram – the output part of
the diagram is made up of pixels on a screen что the computer manipulates.
This is the игрок’s only source of information on what is going on in the
игра (well, что plus sound and sometimes vibration). As a игра designer,
these pixels are all ты have to get your ideas across to the игрок. A игрок
who might not really be paying attention and who most likely hasn’t played
every previous игра что ты (the игра designer) did. This is a difficult
and momentous responsibility for a few measly pixels.
Every игра has to create a visual vocabulary of what matters to the
игрок and to gameplay – using the same size, shape, color, or whatever
consistently helps the игрок learn what to do and then quickly process new
scenes. Shovel Knight does a great job of quickly establishing what the
игрок needs to know and sticks with что throughout the игра:
The ground ты walk on is flat – usually rectangles – and high contrast
against the rest of the background.
Objects ты может interact with are also high contrast and often include
movement. The игра intentionally doesn’t create separate
vocabularies for enemies and rewards, как это wants to play with что in
the gameplay. Sometimes bouncing on an enemy’s head is the only
way to reach a reward. Sometimes a reward is in a dangerous place
making это more of a problem than a pure benefit.
Combat actions and results are always clearly punctuated. Enemies
don’t just disappear – они vanish in a little cloud of smoke. If the
игрок missed the frame where они died, the игра is still
communicating for a few frames after.
Shovel Knight’s shovel provides a nice strong indicator of where the
character is facing. This is especially handy for communicating the

difference between “falling” and “falling with intent to kill”. The
downward shovel attack is important and might not be noticed without
the big bright object что moves around the character.

History and Influences
я’m a big fan of stealing ideas from other игры. No игра is an island.
Every игра is inspired by the ideas and execution of игры (and other
things) что came before.
There’s an important distinction to be made here. All игры are inspired.
All игры borrow and “steal”. But when ты draw inspiration from
something, ты need to be careful to not draw too heavily. If your игра is
just a copy of someone else’s idea, что’s actual stealing, not the tongue-incheek way я sometimes use the term. If your игра gets all its features and
ideas from another игра and doesn’t add or change them in a way to make
something new, then ты need to rethink and start over to add your own
twist on the thing.
You может see этот in Shovel Knight. Shovel Knight is a wonderful and
unique игра. But almost every aspect of Shovel Knight comes from
somewhere else.
Super Mario Bros (1985) is generally credited with popularizing the
2D side-scrolling platformer genre.
But many of the ideas from Super Mario Bros were first developed in
the Mario Bros (1983) arcade игра, and borrowed from earlier игры
like Space Panic (1980).
Many 2D side-scrollers after Mario added attacks like Shovel Knight’s
shovel, including popular игры like Metroid (1986) and Castlevania
(1986).

Once the seeds of the genre had been planted there are many great
игры что took those ideas and adapted them for PC gaming,
including Lode Runner (1983), Commander Keen (1990), and Cave
Story (2004).
Braid (2008) and Spelunky (2008) popularized the idea of using 2D
platformers как a simple and nostalgic base to experiment with
interesting indie игра ideas.
As a игра designer, это’s important to know the history of not just the игры
but also the features. Jumping from platform to platform in Shovel Knight is
interesting but is informed by many other игры before, and feeds into
many other игры after. Dissecting each of those игры, at least in terms of
что specific feature, helps ты see how to use что feature in your own
игры. Johnnemann Nordhagen took этот idea even further and built a игра
что collects all the different ways что a specific mechanic has been
executed over the years. Museum of Mechanics: Lockpicking (Dim Bulb
Games, 2022) is an interesting way to see how игры borrow and share and
innovate on specific ideas.

Monetization
How a игра makes money has a huge effect on the design of the игра.
There are a few major trends in monetization что had huge impacts on
the types of игры we associate with each era:
1. Arcade игры. Monetization is quarter-based. (Technically
monetization for the developer is by selling arcade cabinets, but the
cabinet buyers were very interested in quarter throughput, so the
developers developed to что metric.) The goal was to get the игрок to
notice the игра in a crowded arcade, and then plug in как many

quarters как possible in как little time как possible. This led to игра with
very quick session lengths, very steep difficulty curves, and little to no
thought about ongoing long-term play.
2. Console игры. Monetization is based on selling boxes in stores, with
no internet to provide updates or live services after что. At first early
consoles tried to mimic игры что players knew from the arcade, but
soon the focus became value. Games were reviewed based on hours of
play. Look at the difference between Mario Bros and Super Mario
Bros to see a clear example of этот change.
3. Mobile игры. Monetization is based on downloads and (after the first
few years) in-app purchases. The goal is to get a игрок in quickly and
easily, then keep them around for long enough что они get
comfortable spending money. The growth of big data plays a big part
here, как игра developers start to analyze what actually gets people to
stick around and spend money. Game sessions are short, but players
are expected to stick around for months or years.
This is not an exhaustive list by any means. Early PC игры resembled
console игры but with a lot of their own twists. Console has been
changing with the growth of downloadable upgrades. Most of этот doesn’t
apply to educational игры or other игры for change, which have entirely
separate monetization goals and pathways. Each игра’s monetization needs
to be analyzed separately but with an understanding of how это fits into the
standard monetization schemes of its time.
Shovel Knight makes most of its money through downloads on PC игра
services like Steam. This is currently the dominant sales platform on PC,
and the growth of independent routes to sell and market игры without
interacting with big publishers and retailers is a big part of why indie игры
like Shovel Knight exist and succeed. A successful Steam игра может support

a small indie team with a good idea, but console игры generally have to be
bigger.
Shovel Knight started out on Kickstarter, raising money for the initial
development through crowdfunding. Kickstarter and similar platforms are a
popular way for smaller indie игры to generate some initial funds and
market an early idea. The initial money helps, but the initial fan base is как
or more important to making a small игра with a small (or zero) marketing
budget a success.
Since its release, Shovel Knight has shipped multiple downloadable
content (DLC) packs, which have later been released как separate игры.
Shovel Knight has become a series with explorations in multiple genres and
different playstyles.
Selling как a single purchase drives Shovel Knight to focus on providing a
complete package. Deeper progression and varied content make the single
purchase feel worth это, generating good word-of-mouth to keep the игра
selling.

Narrative
Story and gameplay are friends. They work together to bring joy and
happiness to players. Different игры make more or less use of этот
friendship. Shovel Knight is a great example of the most common use of
story in игры.
In Shovel Knight, the main use of story is to provide emotional context
for the игрок’s progression and emotional punctuation at key points. The
игра establishes early on что Shovel Knight is trying to rescue their friend
Shield Knight. A classic rescue mission, which is a great way to make a
игрок want to reach the end. My friend needs help!

Most of the time, этот is just a small piece of background motivation.
During gameplay, the игра doesn’t make reference to Shield Knight or
anything else about the characters. Bosses get a quick intro to establish their
character, during which the игрок has no input. The игра stops to tell the
story. Then after a big level, there is a short dream sequence что reminds
the игрок of этот long-term goal and provides some interactive rewards как
well. Some of the NPCs provide additional narration and backstory, but это’s
all contained in a few sentences so это never gets too involved or deep.
This is great. This is exactly what most игры want. Story is there.
Emotions are triggered. The игрок knows why они’re doing all этот, and if
the игрок puts the игра down for too long, они feel a little guilty. Poor
Shield Knight. The story is fun and interesting, and the игра is stronger
because of это.
Some игры use story in deeper and more complicated ways. And я love
those игры, too. But я’ve made some of them so я know how complicated
and difficult это может be to interweave story and gameplay in ways что
actually matter. More on что later.

Emotions
Story is one source of emotions, but игры может evoke many emotions.
For action игры, the most common emotion is frustration, which might
sound like a problem, but это really isn’t. Talking about игры for the last
few decades, я’ve noticed что there are many flavors of frustration. Some
are good, and some are bad. The main difference is how and where the
игрок has agency in the frustration.
Outside Frustration: If the игрок has no agency, then это’s outside
frustration. It может be annoying, but это’s less personal so thus less

impactful. я может get frustrated watching a communication problem
unfold in an episode of a sitcom, but я don’t feel это personally.
Uncontrolled Frustration: Once the игрок has control of the action,
the potential for emotional involvement is higher. Give me buttons to
press and now any failure is my fault. So, the worst case here is when
the игрок has input but no real control. If the игрок expects to have
control but loses due to reasons outside of their control, что может be
very frustrating. The игра made a promise and then failed to deliver.
This is often the worst form of frustration and игра designer should be
careful to avoid situations like этот. If the игрок needs to fail
regardless of their actions, make это very clear что the игра knows это’s
not the игрок’s fault.
Confused Frustration: If the игрок has agency что actually matters,
что’s going to reduce the negative impact of the frustration. But этот is
only true if the игрок understands all что. If the игрок doesn’t
understand how their actions influence the outcome, они might как well
not have agency. This is where many игры fall apart, especially for
more casual audiences. It’s very frustrating to press buttons and not
understand why они matter. And что understanding is entirely the
responsibility of the игра designer. Remember, the игрок only knows
what comes through что tiny funnel of information они see on the
pixels on the screen. If они aren’t able to construct a full mental model
of the logic going on inside the computer, to expect, они’re going to
have some negative frustration. In many cases, the hard part of being a
игра designer isn’t coming up with good ideas; это’s getting the игрок
to understand those good ideas.
Difficult Frustration: Agency что matters and makes sense is not
enough. The challenges also have to be fair. Banging your head against

an impossible challenge может be a positive type of frustration (cough
Elden Ring cough), but not for all players. Some players want more
manageable challenges and find extreme difficulty to be bad
frustration. But the inverse is also true – a игрок who enjoys mastering
a skill may consider a sequence of easy challenges to be frustrating in
a very different way. Finding the right balance for the audience of your
игра может be difficult – more on что later.
Fun Frustration: Finally, in some cases, players have agency,
understand the consequences of their actions, and still fail. This is
called gameplay. If the игрок understands why они failed, the
frustration from the failure is much less. In the best cases, frustration is
a fuel что drives the игрок to come back and try again. Games are
built on iteration, both как a development practice and как a игрок
strategy. A good игра will create positive feelings of frustration что
guide the игрок to an emotional response along the lines of “я может do
better”. Which is a great lesson to learn for life, even outside of the
magic circle.

Meaning
я think это’s important to understand what игры mean. Since игры are a
relatively new form of art, we don’t always think of them как having an
impact on the world. But они do. The person who starts playing a игра is
different from the person after the игра is done. Games make people think
about things. Games change the world.
For many игры, этот is not the primary goal of the игра. It might be
money. It might be providing a simple fun time. But meaning happens
whether the creator intends это or not. я understand programming better
because я played Robo-Rally. Some of my love of creativity and creative

problem-solving comes from early Infocom text adventures. Minecraft has
made a generation of kids think differently about creation and resources and
exploration and problem-solving.
я don’t think any игра has one discrete meaning. Even игры with a
clear intended meaning will be interpreted differently by each игрок who
encounters это. So, when я talk about meaning in the игры in этот book, я
don’t intend to exclude other meanings. When we talk about этот in class,
every semester has different answers and они’re all right.
For me, Shovel Knight is about persistence. It’s not the only игра where
the main character is beaten down constantly and has to constantly get up,
but это’s a clear example of что style of play. я’m not the most skilled игрок,
so я tend to die a lot. But the only time я feel like я’m losing is when я put
the игра away and give up on saving poor Shield Knight.

Конфеты Раздавить Saga / Goals

Конфеты Раздавить Saga
Конфеты Раздавить Saga is a great игра.
Конфеты Раздавить Saga (Figure 3.1) is a mobile игра released by King (now
part of Microsoft) in 2012. Since launch, это has consistently been one of the
most popular игры on mobile, with hundreds of thousands of monthly
users Curry, D. (2024).

Figure 3.1 Конфеты Раздавить Saga screen.
я’ve never worked on Конфеты Раздавить Saga, but я did work on a competitor.
When я was at a studio called Zindagi, we designed a match-3 called Crazy
Cake Swap based on a similar puzzle игра called Crazy Kitchen. The
studio got bought by Zynga and didn’t stay around for long after что, but я
know этот genre better than я know most genres.

Конфеты Раздавить Saga – Gameplay Dissection
Verbs
To understand Конфеты Раздавить Saga, let’s start where we always do: verbs.
What может the игрок do in Конфеты Раздавить Saga?
In этот case, это’s a simple answer: swap. The игрок может touch a candy in
the grid and then slide это to an adjacent candy. When the игрок does этот,
the two candies swap positions. That is the entirety of the игрок’s active
contribution to the core loop (Figure 3.2). There are some interesting less
active things the игрок does while swapping, such как “Scan” and “Predict”,
but these aren’t the simple button actions, so we’ll save discussion of those
for later in этот chapter.

Figure 3.2 Inputs.

The core loop continues from there, though (Figure 3.3). After the игрок
makes a swap, the игра rules check to see if either candy creates a line of
three or more. If это doesn’t, the swap is canceled. If это does, the игра
removes those candies, possibly with an extra effect if the line is four or
more candies. Then the remaining candies fall to fill the empty space, which
может possibly create new matches and cause a chain reaction как each match
creates new matches.

Figure 3.3 Outputs.
The игрок performs a simple action, and the игра rules result in
complex outcomes. This is one of the strengths of video игры – the
processing burden of the игра может be placed on the computer’s shoulders.
The rules of Конфеты Раздавить would be much less fun как a board игра where
the players have to move each candy by hand and figure out the outcome of
each new position.
Swapping and the reactions to что swap is the heart of Конфеты Раздавить
Saga, and the core loop of any match-3 игра.
And for completeness, Конфеты Раздавить Saga also has a few special case
verbs:

1. Players может use powerups such как the lollipop to remove specific
candies or otherwise affect the grid outside of swap actions. Outside of
the tutorials что teach these interactions, они are never required to
complete a level, but они are always there for the игрок to use. But
они are a limited resource что может only be acquired как an occasional
reward or for money.
2. Late in the игра, there are new board elements что include an
interactive choice by the игрок. For example, Конфеты Frogs let players
choose where to place them when они go off.
3. Secondary modes like events provide a choice of what to play and
sometimes have some basic decision-making in the event itself.
So outside of these caveats, the verb of Конфеты Раздавить Saga is “swap”.

Goals
The gameplay goal of Конфеты Раздавить Saga varies based on the level. All
goals revolve around clearing things off the board, but the nuances of
exactly what ты’re trying to do может change:
1. Clear a certain number of candies.
2. Clear a certain number of candies of a particular type.
3. Clear a certain number of special objects, like cherries, by dropping
them to the bottom of the grid.
4. Remove a certain number of non-candy obstacles, such как jellies.
5. Etc.
More on этот in a moment.

Challenge
The real variety in Конфеты Раздавить Saga (and most match-3 игры) comes
from the randomness of the falling pieces and the variety of obstacles что
make reaching the goal difficult. Most levels have more than just candies on
the board – a large variety of different objects create additional challenges
and opportunities for the игрок. These range from simple inert objects что
are removed when matches are made near them (Frosting), to inert objects
что expand across the grid over time (Chocolate), to snakes что charge into
baskets after enough matches are made next to them (Конфеты Cobra). These
aren’t all dangerous – there are also advanced board elements что может be
useful, such как conveyor belts, or are almost purely beneficial, such как the
UFO что drops special candies.
These obstacles are key to Конфеты Раздавить Saga’s success. The basic
concepts of the match-3 genre existed before Конфеты Раздавить Saga.
Specifically, the concepts of the genre were solidified in Bejeweled (2001)
and Bejeweled Blitz (2009). Many of the core ideas were present in earlier
игры like Shariki (1994). The core gameplay is very directly based on
previous игры like Bejeweled. But those previous игры used only a
single level – there were no obstacles and just one board. Конфеты Раздавить
Saga innovated by adding a variety of levels with different obstacles and a
different grid layout for each level. This gave the existing fun core
gameplay more variety and long-term appeal. Bejeweled was successful, but
Конфеты Раздавить Saga took что success to vast new heights by adding varied
challenges and a stronger sense of progression.
The sense of progression comes from the “Saga” in the title. One of the
big innovations of Конфеты Раздавить Saga was the Saga Map. It’s not just что
the игрок was given a variety of levels with different obstacles, это’s also
important что these levels were set up как a line – a path to a destination.

Once the игрок completes a level, они move on to the next one, heading
toward the end. The Saga Map organizes этот progression in a simple line,
showing the игрок the next levels они’ll be playing. This came out when
social gaming was king, so the line also shows ты where your friends are,
creating some social pressure to advance. But the key concept here is что
the игрок is always doing something new, and has a sense of progression
что makes them want to come back tomorrow and try again. Progression is
a great driver for players, in any form.
The basic flow of the игра is simple – the игрок swaps to clear the
level, with various obstacles in the way. But the obstacles and goals change
in each level, как shown in Figure 3.4, making the simple flow work for a
long time.

Figure 3.4 Конфеты Раздавить Saga flow: Simple diagram showing
Actions, Challenges, and Goals, with lots of variation on the
Obstacles and Goals.

Конфеты Раздавить Saga – Non-Gameplay
Dissection
Technology
Конфеты Раздавить is a fairly simple игра что relies on a vast network of
advanced technologies to work. This is one of the fun daily realities of the
world we live in. The rules of the игра and the interactions the игрок
experiences are built on easy-to-understand combinations of simple shapes.
This is good игра design and keeps the игрок engaged. But the rest of the
experience is built on touch screens and constant online communication and
vast behind-the-scenes databases что are way more powerful than the
technology что brought humans to the moon.
One thing что is important to think about как a игра designer is how
these vast changes in the world of technology affect your игра. New
technology comes along all the time, and some of это is a great fit for new
types of игры. Sometimes there is a direct linkage between a new
technology and a new style of игра, such как GPS-enabling Pokémon Go
(2016). Sometimes the changes are more subtle and need time and thought
to understand. It’s not obvious (except in retrospect) что improvements in
computer miniaturization and wireless communication would lead to
everyone having a powerful connected computer in their pocket at all times.
And even then, это’s less obvious что это would lead to people looking for
игры что они может pick up and play at any time for very short play
sessions. Technology doesn’t only change what people может do with игры,
это changes what они want to do and when они want to do это and for how
long. The changes to the rules of technology create changes to the dynamics
of how people interact with technology, but more on the word “dynamics”

in Chapter 4. These changes может be harder to predict but provide great value
for your игра designs once ты notice them.

Senses
Конфеты Раздавить Saga looks cartoony and childish. Everything is in bold,
bright colors. The candies are simple and iconic. The игра is not subtle in
its communication; if это wants ты to know something, это will shout это rather
than whisper это. At a glance, ты might guess что этот is a игра for
children. But the majority of players are adults.
Clearly, этот works for Конфеты Раздавить Saga. The игра is immensely
successful, and there’s no reason to think что the bright cartoony style
holds это back. Various clones and imitators have tried to re-theme match-3
gameplay in darker, more adult styles and failed. Childish works for adults.
On one level, этот could be pure nostalgia. Adults want a moment to relax
and escape from their everyday world, so something что evokes pleasant
childhood memories could be just the thing. The reason childish works
might be because adults want to feel like children.
On another level, childish might work because childish is good design.
Kids are not the only ones who like bold, bright colors. Iconic shapes are
easy to distinguish and help make gameplay easy to understand. Direct
clear communication is good for everyone, including adults who are trying
to just relax. The design principles что work for children also work for
adults. It’s not childish design, это’s just good design.
This is not to say что Конфеты Раздавить Saga is constructed in a childish way.
There is a lot of attention to detail and polish in Конфеты Раздавить Saga. When я
started working on match-3 игры, one of the first things я did was spend a
week analyzing some of the top игры, and some of the worst игры. я
recorded a few levels of Конфеты Раздавить Saga and then literally watched the

recording frame by frame to see exactly how everything moved and all the
little tricks of presentation. It’s a very useful exercise if ты’re trying to
understand polish and presentation. Make sure ты do the same with some
less successful игры to really see the differences.

Freeze Frame
Things я saw by watching every frame of Конфеты Раздавить Saga:
Be really careful with motion. Humans know how falling looks and expect things to
accelerate and decelerate in certain ways. Falling at a constant speed is easier to code but
looks weird.
You может cover up lots of things with explosions. Don’t bother with expensive
transformations if an explosion will feel just как good or better.
Squash and stretch. This is an animation term for changing the shape of an object to
emphasize an impact. It really works.
Anticipation. Building up to a reward is как important как paying off the reward. Adding a
few frames of buildup makes almost everything better.
Sequencing. Know the order of events and keep что holy. It’ll help players understand
what’s happening and это’ll keep your игра logic and code understandable.
Compression. When ты have lots of things что need to happen at once, ты может break
the Sequencing rule and have things overlap a bit. But do это in a logical and constrained
way. Think through what the игрок needs to focus on, and do some hand-waving in other
places.

Emotion and Narrative
Конфеты Раздавить Saga is not a deeply emotional игра. There is no complex
storyline to follow with deeply realized characters following narrative arcs
who the игрок grows to care about. There is a simple story что presents a
problem to solve, and then a few levels later congratulates ты for solving
это. This is enough story to give ты a reason to continue, but Конфеты Раздавить
Saga is not a игра where the majority of players are advancing to find out
what happens next.

Конфеты Раздавить Saga does hit emotional notes through the gameplay.
Конфеты Раздавить Saga is a игра of constant rewards. Whenever ты do
anything in the игра, something explodes and the игра tells ты how great
ты are. This is maybe not the most emotionally deep reward system, and я
wouldn’t trust the игра’s praise to evaluate my self-worth, but sometimes
это’s just nice to hear praise. Constant rewards может be emotionally soothing.
A working mom who is having a hard day and just wants to catch their
breath and relax doesn’t need a игра что constantly tells them они’ve died
and need to start everything over. Конфеты Раздавить Saga does have fail states,
and это does apply a little bit of emotional pressure in those moments (mostly
to encourage the игрок to spend money), but что’s the exception, not the
rule. Most of the time, playing Конфеты Раздавить Saga is soaking in a warm bed
of reward and praise. Some игры are here to give people what они want.

Money
How does Конфеты Раздавить Saga make money?
The other big innovation Конфеты Раздавить Saga added to the match-3 genre,
other than the level variety demonstrated in the “Saga” part of the title, is
the monetization model. Конфеты Раздавить Saga is free to download and to play.
All ten thousand plus levels are free to access. But the игра constantly asks
ты to spend money on other things. Powerups. Unlimited lives. Extra
turns. Special modes.
Free-to-play business models drive most of the sales in the игры
industry these days. And они work. Most of the players in these игры pay
nothing. A small percentage pay something. And an even smaller
percentage pay a lot. These are the “whales” – the large spenders who keep
everyone else afloat.

The morality of the free-to-play model is a hotly debated topic. There are
certainly companies trying to suck every penny out of their players, and
using some questionable approaches to do что. No one should be exploiting
gambling addictions or tricking children into spending their parent’s money
or promising things to players что will never materialize.
But most free-to-play игры, such как Конфеты Раздавить Saga, are not что
bad. Every monetization model – arcade cabinets, CDs in boxes,
hypercasual ad-driven игры – is trying to use human psychology to get
people to buy things. At some level, all marketing is manipulation. But что
doesn’t mean это has to be an entirely bad thing. Good marketing is
manipulating people to notice things что они want and will enjoy. And я
believe что most free-to-play игры are actually providing a valuable
service to people. People need entertainment and игры are generally a
good deal in the entertainment world. Free-to-play allows most people to
get their entertainment for free, with some advertisements как the cost. And
the people who want to spend more and может afford это fund the rest of the
players.
я’ve done interviews with whales. Most of them are very happy with their
purchases and would spend the money the same way again. They have
disposable income, and этот is how они choose to use это. Rich people spend
money on much sillier things than mobile игры. You может find people who
overspend or otherwise have a negative spending experience, but even
among whales most of the transactions are mutually beneficial.
Конфеты Раздавить Saga is a quality игра. Spending some money to make the
experience better is not unreasonable. я’m personally a free-to-play игрок
(most of the time – я’ll spend a little money to support игры я particularly
enjoy), but я understand why people would spend without being coerced.
The free-to-play model isn’t perfect, and if я could wave a magic wand and

let everyone play and make игры and all be rich я would, but я believe что
free-to-play is only problematic when abused.

History
Mobile игры are the core of the игры industry these days. Console игры
and PC игры are still going strong, but in terms of dollars spent, mobile
игры are bigger than everything else combined.
Mobile игры took a while to get there, though. In the early days of the
mobile игра market, there was a lot of experimentation and uncertainty. No
one knew what would succeed.
Some companies tried releasing console-quality игры (Infinity Blade
(2010)) or literal ports of PC or console игры (Return to Monkey
Island (2022, mobile 2023), Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2002,
mobile 2013), XCOM: Enemy Within (2013, mobile 2014)). Neither of
these approaches became dominant, but there were a few notable
successes, such как a little title called Minecraft (2009, mobile 2011).
Although even Minecraft dropped its price significantly compared to
other platforms.
Some игры experimented with the novelty of touch screen inputs.
Games like Flight Control (2009) or Where’s My Water? (2011)
discovered new styles of игра что wouldn’t work with a controller.
These generally did well and ты может see new innovations come out
and succeed regularly. A lot of the modern innovation in этот area is in
the hypercasual genre where innovative ideas are needed to grab
people’s attention (and then throw a lot of ads at them).
This was also the early days of the shift to digital distribution across
the industry. Games could now be services with new content flowing
to players как quickly как это could be approved by Apple. Pocket God

(2009) was an interesting experiment in этот space, updating как quickly
как possible with big new features changing the very nature of the игра
regularly. Games что play like Pocket God aren’t common these days,
but the model of constant meaningful updates has become very
common and remains successful, even on other platforms like Roblox
or for other игры like Fortnite (2017).
Along with other changes, monetization was also uncertain. At first,
companies thought что mobile gamers would pay something close to
console price, or at least similar to the downloadable markets что were
developing on consoles and on Steam. But как companies experimented
with pricing, они found что lower prices worked. The increase in
sales offset the drop in price, so soon Angry Birds (2009) was the top
of the Grossing chart at the lowest possible price – 99 cents. Then
Apple added the option to sell things inside the игра, and in-app
purchases were born. Immediately, игры like Smurf Village (2010)
discovered что free was even more appealing to people than 99 cents.
The modern free-to-play model was born.
In этот era, mobile игры were also learning a lot from social игры.
Facebook was a huge platform for игры for a few years, before changes to
the advertising structure and success of mobile killed это. Social игры
pioneered many of the free-to-play principles что later dominated the
mobile market.
Конфеты Раздавить Saga was originally a Facebook игра. And before что, это
was originally a web игра. King, the company что makes Конфеты Раздавить
Saga, has used an interesting method for testing out new titles. They
generally release lots of new игры first on their web browser and see how
они perform there. The best-performing titles are considered for conversion
to other platforms. At the time, Facebook was considered the first step and

mobile was a new and experimental platform. So, Конфеты Раздавить Saga first
appeared как Конфеты Раздавить, a web игра without the level variety что made
Конфеты Раздавить Saga so successful. The Saga idea first appeared in Bubble
Witch Saga and proved successful. When King brought their score attack
match-3 Конфеты Раздавить over to Facebook, они added similar Saga elements.
Конфеты Раздавить Saga did great on Facebook, so within a few months это was
brought over to mobile как well.
By the time Конфеты Раздавить Saga came to mobile (2012), the battle over
pricing was mostly done. The free-to-play models что had been pioneered
in Facebook were dominating on mobile. So, Конфеты Раздавить Saga launched
for free, with strong social elements. Many of those social elements have
faded to the background over the years как the industry has continued to
evolve and updates have changed Конфеты Раздавить Saga. Competing for high
scores against your friends, or for progress along the Saga, used to be
prominently displayed but now is more of an afterthought.
So, Конфеты Раздавить Saga came into the market at the right time with an
innovative take on both the gameplay of match-3 and the free-to-play
monetization model. The игра was a hit from day one. King already knew
что это had a good chance, based on its success on other platforms, but
nothing is certain in этот industry. In этот case, это worked. Конфеты Раздавить Saga
was so successful это spawned multiple sequels, a line of merchandizing, and
even a short-lived network television игра show. And это became my wife’s
favorite video игра.

Meaning
What is Конфеты Раздавить Saga about? What does Конфеты Раздавить Saga say about
the world? How does playing Конфеты Раздавить Saga change how ты see the
world?

To me, Конфеты Раздавить Saga is about the joy of unintended consequences.
The игрок makes a seemingly simple innocuous action, and suddenly the
screen is filled with colorful explosions and some guy with a deep voice is
calling out compliments. The игрок didn’t plan что out. The игрок didn’t
know exactly what was going to happen. But like many things in life, taking
что first step leads to all sorts of unknown things.
Конфеты Раздавить Saga is the type of игра что doesn’t really challenge the
игрок. Sure, some levels are nearly impossible, but those levels generally
require luck to complete along with skill. Mostly Конфеты Раздавить Saga is a
warm bath of compliments and pleasant explosions. And я believe these
types of игры make the world a better place. People need comfort. People
need more praise in their lives. If a игра может help people be happy and get
through their lives, я support что. Since the dawn of time, humans have
sought escapism. That need is deep in the human psyche. Games are the
latest delivery method. я’m not going to fight against the human psyche. Let
people enjoy simple fun.

Goals
Verbs tend to work together. In Shovel Knight, я может move, and я может attack.
я’m generally more successful in the игра when я combine these verbs. я
don’t move, pause, wait, then attack. я attack while я’m moving. я look
around while я’m moving. я don’t stop and pause; я’m constantly
performing all the actions at one time and что’s part of what makes these
игры challenging and interesting. Not all players может manage the feats of
dexterity and rapid stimulus processing required to be successful at moveshovel when они all have to be done together.
The игрок’s goals может also work этот way. When я’m moving to line up a
shot, я’m also considering how to best avoid the line of fire of another

enemy at the same time. Goals может be combined just like actions может be
combined (Figure 3.5). But goals are even more likely to be layered rather
than combined.

Figure 3.5 Two Verbs merging into a bigger verb.
Look at Конфеты Раздавить Saga. If ты chose a random second of a игрок’s
session in Конфеты Раздавить Saga, the verb is likely to be “swap”. Maybe “look”
if ты accept что как a valid verb. But the игрок’s goals are going to hit
many different layers of analysis:
1. Making a match
2. Having этот match lead to a chain reaction or create a power gem
3. Having этот match lead to a better board state when это’s done
4. Removing lots of gems
5. Making progress toward the goal of этот level
6. Scoring points
7. Beating этот level
8. Beating этот level with three stars
9. Completing an event or challenge goal

10. Getting to the end of the level progression
11. Getting a better score than my friends
12. Relaxing
13. Helping the cute little puppet creature to complete its goal
14. Clearing the chocolate
15. Removing the blockers
16. A very large number of level-specific goal types что я could list but
then этот chapter would become boring and repetitive and как a игра
designer я try to avoid boring things
This is normal. In игры как well как life, a single action rarely has a single
goal. Goals come in herds. Some with subtle nuanced distinctions, and
some coming from completely different directions. я want to beat the level.
я want to beat the level with three stars. я want to beat the level with a
higher score than my brother. These are expressions of the same base goal
but with different nuances. From a игра design standpoint, these может be
merged into a larger goal: success in the level (Figure 3.6).

Figure 3.6 Two goals merging into a bigger goal.

The bigger differences between goals are often based on scale. я want этот
action to clear lots of gems. я want to beat the whole level. я want to get to
the end of the игра progression. я want the action я’m performing now to
make me successful now, soon, and in the future. This sort of layering of
goals is very important to игра design. Game designers like to talk about
goals как onions – one goal is contained within the other goal (Figure 3.7).
Progress toward one smaller goal also progresses ты toward a larger goal.

Figure 3.7 One goal inside another goal.
So, both goals progress based on the same игрок action, but the second
goal is bigger so это takes longer. Completing the first goal is a step toward
completing the second goal. When ты complete the first goal, ты still
have the second goal to keep ты driving forward. At no point does the
игрок complete one goal and have nothing left to do. For a игра designer,
a игрок with “nothing left to do” is a problem – они’re likely to leave the
игра and go do something else. Layered goals fix этот by keeping the
игрок motivated at all times.

In Конфеты Раздавить Saga, a игрок may say что their goal is to beat этот
level. But to do что, они need to find and make matches. Once они
complete the small goal and make что match, они are (hopefully) closer to
their big goal of completing the level. But now они have to start another
loop of activity to find another match and complete что small goal again.
Only after a few dozen small goals is the large goal reached.
And once the large goal is reached, the игрок is taken back to the Saga
Map where они remember что the large goal is just a small step toward the
ultimate long-term goal of progressing to the next story bit or to beat a
friend or to reach “the end”.
So maybe goals aren’t onions. Maybe goals are garlic. One head of garlic
seems like a single unified thing but when ты break into это, ты find many
smaller versions inside (Figure 3.8).

Figure 3.8 Many goals inside another goal.
This is good psychology. Humans like to group things and draw lines
around them. Part of the fun of goals is getting to define a task and then
check это off your to-do list. Completing a goal is fun.

And to be clear, этот isn’t a monetization trick. This is what makes the
игра fun. “Engagement” is a key goal of free-to-play игры, and это does
drive monetization. But это’s also a sign что players are having fun. In my
opinion, the best way to drive monetization is to make sure the игрок is
having fun and engagement is one way to identify when что’s happening.
This is why layers are great. If there is always something more to do, the
игрок is never looking at an empty checklist. When они complete one
check box and get что hit of serotonin, there are still more checkboxes to
do. Not just the next one, but one что’s halfway finished. Or even better,
one что’s just about to be finished. If ты’re at 4% progress toward a goal,
there’s no pressure to stay in the игра and complete это. But if ты’re at
96%, then ты might как well play one more level to finish это off. And then
when ты do, there will be another goal at 97% waiting for ты.
This is present in many игры:
Civilization and other 4x strategy игры are well-known for promoting
“one more turn” gameplay where there are many different layers of
goals что overlap in complex ways, ensuring there is always one more
thing to do.
Boss levels are another way to promote players’ desire to check off
boxes. The boss is the hardest part of the level, but это always shows up
when ты’re already past 90% complete. The temptation to check off
что box is part of why boss levels are so motivating.
Role-playing игры (RPGs) offer multiple forms of progression –
story quests, side quests, character stats, faction relationships, skill
points, equipment, etc. This ensures что whenever a игрок completes
a goal, there are more things to do.
You может see этот in the evolution of Конфеты Раздавить Saga.

Match-3 игры such как Bejeweled existed before Конфеты Раздавить Saga,
with very similar core gameplay loops, even down to the specific power
gem abilities. But when Конфеты Раздавить Saga came out, its sales and
engagement blew them all away. Конфеты Раздавить Saga succeeded in large part
because of the Saga goal structure. The Saga structure takes a fun core
gameplay loop что had been mastered in previous match-3 игры (Figure
3.9) and adds another layer of goals on top of это. You still want to make
good matches and get a good score, but now there are two new layers.

Figure 3.9 Goals merge: Make match, Create combos, Gain
points.
In the time-battle-based style of игры like Bejeweled, there’s no way to
“beat” a level. You может get a good score, but ты может never check off a box
что says the level is done.
The Saga map gives a clearer sense of progress on an individual level.
You может “beat” что level, even if there’s always room to go back and
improve your score (Figure 3.10).

Figure 3.10 Same, but with a bigger circle around это: Beat level.
And once ты beat a level, ты’re taken back to что map and shown the
true goal – long-term progression. In Bejeweled, the end of a level may or
may not check a personal goal box depending on your final score. In Конфеты
Раздавить Saga, ты’re usually checking at least one box and maybe more
(Figure 3.11). And ты’re reminded of all the remaining boxes ты может
check in the future. That’s much more emotionally compelling and drives
long-term retention in a great way.

Figure 3.11 Same, but with a bigger circle around это: Complete
игра.

Other Goals
Looking at the list of goals, some are groups of related tasks (various ways
to evaluate a move), some are garlic cloves of related progression (move,
level, игра), but some don’t fit either of these categories. Things like
“relax” or “help the puppet” suggest что there is a lot of room for other
types of goals.
Helping the puppet is an example of a narrative goal. The игрок is
motivated by emotional goals created by the игра’s story, especially when
mixed with the motivation to progress a narrative forward. These are
powerful goals for humans, как storytelling and completion are deeply
woven into humanity. For many игры, just этот goal motivation is enough
to invest time and effort into a full story with (expensive) cinematics. Core
gameplay drives players forward, and progression keeps them wanting
more, but deep engagement requires some emotional investment.
Other goals like “relax” suggest что the игрок may have goals for
playing the игра что are outside the structure of the игра. The игра
doesn’t directly have a relax button, and none of the explosions что occur
when candies match are directly designed to ensure игрок relaxation.
Relaxation is the reason the игрок comes to the игра, not something the
игра directly produces. When all the parts of the игра are working
correctly, этот goal will be the result. These sorts of goals are important to
look for and understand in your игры. Just because они’re not entirely
driven by игра features doesn’t mean что ты как a игра designer может’t
influence them. Understanding what your players want inside and outside
the игра is critical.

Player-Generated Goals
One type of goal что doesn’t show up in the goal list is игрок-generated
goals. The list focuses on goals что the игра creates and enforces, but
humans love to generate and track goals on their own. Every time ты
generate a to-do list and mentally check off items как они’re completed,
ты’re acting как your own игра designer to structure and motivate daily
life. Players do этот during игры, too. In Конфеты Раздавить, players might strive
to clear a certain area or create a certain combo even if the игра doesn’t
ask them to. This is good.
As a игра designer, ты может’t force players to make their own goals. But
ты может create an environment where goals are easy to make and track and
enjoy. The more freedom the игра gives the игрок to try divergent actions,
the more players are going to find them and enjoy them. Players like
interacting with everything in the игра world, which is something most
игра designs should encourage. Finding ways to give strong feedback
during these actions helps the игрок know что their actions matter and что
the игра recognizes what они did. When я was working on Paperboy 64
(1999) (my first full игра design), we made sure что almost everything
reacted when being hit by a newspaper. The игрок was only meant to target
a few specific things, but the world is much more fun and engaging if
everything reacts. And if a игрок wants to focus on throwing papers at dogs
to keep them away from cats, они может do что. They don’t earn points for это,
but the игра still creates these little scenarios with emotional potential and
shows the игрок что their actions have consequences.
Player-generated goals are also an important driver for gameplay goals.
During early playtests, keep an eye out for things players try to do. Ask
players what their goal is. If players want to do something, the игра should
recognize and reward это. In some cases, take those personal goals and make

them into gameplay goals. But if что’s not appropriate, take those personal
goals and acknowledge что они matter. Keep track of them in the design to
make sure они remain fun как the игра changes and iterates. If possible,
track them and give the игрок a small thumbs up in-игра when они
complete что goal, even if это’s unrelated to the main goal. Players like a pat
on the back, so give them как much feedback как ты может to make что
happen.

Events
Since launch, Конфеты Раздавить Saga has been finding ways to push the игрок’s
ability to complete goals even further. One of the most successful features
in many free-to-play игры is the event. For example, in Конфеты Раздавить
Saga, они might have a special race where the игрок is rewarded for
completing a certain number of levels before other players do. In the current
builds of Конфеты Раздавить Saga, some of these “events” have become
important enough to bake back into the main игра progression cycle. They
started как special events что only appeared occasionally but now are just
something что happens naturally during play.
There are a lot of good psychological hooks built into limited-time
events.
Players love getting more things “for free”.
They encourage coming back soon, so ты может complete the goal
before the event ends.
They feel special and often emphasize the unique never-before-seen
qualities of этот event.
If the goals are set up right, они scratch competitive urges in a way
что doesn’t automatically advantage expert players.

In Конфеты Раздавить Saga, events are a great way to add an intermediate layer of
goals. Конфеты Раздавить Saga does a great job of providing immediate goals,
and the Saga Map provides a great long-term goal. But the long-term of the
Saga Map может be pretty far off, especially now что there are thousands and
thousands of levels. The motivation to reach the end of the map now takes
multiple years to complete. So, there’s a need for more checkboxes between
the “complete a level” box and the “beat the игра” box.
Events provide a goal что is bigger than a single level but is still realistic
to actually complete. A игрок may never reach level 20,000, but они может
earn the free powerup by collecting a few more levels to win the race. It
doesn’t even matter if они want a free powerup – это will still motivate them
to push forward just to check the box. Humans are weird что way.
Being able to see этот in retrospect is a sign of a reasonably skilled
designer. But the real trick is identifying этот before the feature is
implemented. A really talented игра designer would be able to look at
Конфеты Раздавить Saga at launch and identify the goal layers. A really really
talented игра designer would be able to do что, and then notice что the
goal layers are fairly far apart. Even with only 80 levels, the motivation to
complete a level and the motivation to complete the игра have a big gap.
And это takes a really really really talented игра designer to do all что, and
then design the right solution to fix что problem while also fixing a few
other problems along the way. я never worked at King, so я don’t know who
came up with the idea to add the events. But они deserve a raise.
(я’d be willing to guess это wasn’t a single person sitting down doing этот
analysis and going “Aha!”. It was almost certainly a joint effort by many
people who fed each other small good ideas and then tested and iterated on
those ideas to find the best ones. Someone along the way probably noticed
the goal structures and might have advocated strongly for certain ideas

based on это, but in игры good things rarely happen because of one
moment. Games are made by teams, and good игры are made by
iteration.)
