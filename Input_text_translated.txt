Chapter 2
Shovel Knight / Verbs
DOI: 10.1201/9781003346586-2

Shovel Knight is a great ゲーム.
Shovel Knight came out in 2014 when indie ゲーム were just becoming a
thing. Shovel Knight is a great example of the retro movement, where
ゲーム are created to honor the classic ゲーム of old. Shovel Knight evokes
the feel of old-school 2D platforms like Super Mario Bros or Castlevania
but also adds its own unique twists.
This dissection is specific to Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope, the original
ゲーム in the series (Figure 2.1). Sequels and spinoffs usually require their
own dissections, even if some aspects may be the same.

Shovel Knight: Gameplay Dissection
Verbs
To understand a ゲーム, the best place to start is the verbs. What actions できる
the プレーヤー take?
Games are different from other forms of entertainment like books and
movies. の biggest difference is それ in ゲーム, the プレーヤー gets to do things.
の プレーヤー できる change what happens in the experience through their choices
and other actions. When あなた’re reading Hamlet (Shakespeare 1604), it’s
always going to end the same way, and Hamlet’s always going to drag his
feet to get there. When あなた’re playing a ゲーム of Go with a friend, あなた
don’t know who’s going to win or how they’re going to do it. That
combination of agency and uncertainty is what makes ゲーム fun. Games
are interactive.
So, when あなた’re trying to understand a ゲーム, start with questions about
interactivity. What does the プレーヤー do? What actions できる the プレーヤー take?
There’s more to understand than just それ, but it’s a good place to start.
In Shovel Knight, the プレーヤー できる move around and hit things with a
shovel. Movement is a combination of running and jumping. の core
gameplay is Run, Jump, and Attack. の プレーヤー できる complete 90% of the
ゲーム by just doing these three things. These are the core actions of これ
ゲーム.
But how do we know それ? Let’s dig a little deeper.

Advanced Verb-ing
One theme throughout これ book is それ ゲーム dissections depend on your
goals として a dissector. If あなた’re just trying to get a rough understanding of
Shovel Knight, understanding それ the プレーヤー’s actions are Run, Jump, and

Attack is enough. Stop there, move on. That’s a completely valid approach
and あなた できる pat yourself on the back.
But sometimes あなた need to know more. If あなた’re going to start work on
the a 2d platformer team, or あなた’re going to make a ゲーム inspired by
Shovel Knight, or あなた’re writing a dissertation on it, あなた need to understand
プレーヤー actions at a deeper level.
And sometimes the verbs may not be として obvious. If あなた’re not sure what
counts として a core action, あなた may need to spend a little more time analyzing
before あなた できる say それ with authority.
When あなた’re doing a deep analysis of a new ゲーム, it’s useful to start
with every verb あなた できる think of. Go through the controller diagram. Think
about what あなた do when あなた play the ゲーム, especially the choices それ あなた
deliberate over. Ask your friends “What do あなた do in これ ゲーム?” Read the
wiki if there is one. Write it all down として a starting point.
Let’s do それ for Shovel Knight:
Run
Run Right (right on the controller while on the ground)
Run Left (left on the controller while on the ground)
Attack (press the attack button, officially called “Dig Slash”)
Jump (jump button while on the ground)
Jump Right (jump button while moving right)
Jump Left (jump button while moving left)
Fall (what happens after あなた jump or are in the air for another reason)
Air Control (moving right/left while in the air)
Drop Attack (a combination of falling and attacking triggered by
pressing down while in the air, officially called “Shovel Drop”)
Dodge (move or jump to avoid an enemy or other hazard)

Fight (move and attack against an enemy, with a combination of
different actions mixed together)
Boss Fight (fight, but with more complicated things going on)
Wait (don’t do anything, sometimes important to get timing right)
Dig (attack a pile of dirt to get things out of it)
Break (attack an object like a chest or wall to destroy it)
Loot (technically pulling things out of a chest is a different action than
breaking the chest open)
Juggle (hit something それ is falling, which sends it up again)
Die (lose health or fall in a pit)
Talk (press up while near a Non-Player Character (NPC) to initiate
dialog)
Buy (choose a text option to spend money or otherwise acquire a
thing)
Fish (use an inventory item to try to get stuff)
Use Relic (use an inventory item at the cost of Magic, with about a
dozen different ones それ できる be acquired)
Drink (use an inventory item to gain a bonus)
Play Music (select music via a conversation with an NPC)
Charge Slash (a modified attack earned later in the ゲーム)
Uncover (sometimes when あなた destroy something, there is another
object or enemy behind it それ enters the scene)
Mini-Game (there are places where あなた できる play little sub-ゲーム with
different goals)
Explore (look around and move around to find something new)
Find (basically the same として Explore, but possibly referring to a specific
thing あなた were looking for)

Gather (pick up coins or other things, which happens naturally when
the character touches them)
Collect (usually used to mean the same thing として Gather but できる also
refer to Feats or other more abstract things)
Plan (connect a series of actions in your mind and think about using
them together, possibly with specific timing)
Position (place yourself in the right place)
Observe (watch how the objects in the world work)
Learn (uncover the systems of the ゲーム and how they work)
Predict (use what あなた’ve learned to come up with a theory about what
will happen next)
Watch (cut scenes)
Travel (move on the map view それ is used to select level)
Showdown (a separate play mode それ I’m ignoring for これ dissection)
Challenge Mode (another separate play mode)
New Game (UI action to start a ゲーム)
Enter Name (UI action to label a ゲーム save)
Body Swap (change avatar appearance)
You できる see how これ list できる get pretty long. Let’s talk about how to turn
これ big list into a smaller list それ is more useful.
To start, let’s analyze these words. Which verbs relate to each other?
Which do あなた think of together when あなた’re playing?

Pre-Verbs
If あなた’re dissecting an idea for a new ゲーム あなた’re thinking about, あなた won’t have a controller
diagram to get あなた started. Instead, あなた need to identify the verbs based on the information あなた
do have.
When あなた’re describing the idea to people, what actions do あなた talk about?
When あなた play the ゲーム in your head, what is it それ あなた’re doing?
Picture the ゲーム on a controller. What would the buttons do?
This might be hard. の inspiration for a ゲーム idea できる start with a story or a cool new feature
or other things. But if あなた find それ your ゲーム idea doesn’t have clear verbs, それ’s a sign それ
your idea isn’t really complete yet.
Understanding the core loop is a key part of early ideation. You できる’t pitch a ゲーム if あなた
できる’t describe what the プレーヤー is going to actually do in それ ゲーム. If これ happens, あなた need to
spend some more time thinking これ through before moving on.

Direct Action Verbs
Since we’re trying to understand interactivity, we want to focus on verbs
それ are about the プレーヤー directly doing something. Look for verbs where the
プレーヤー does something それ sends input to the computer – これ できる be
pressing a button, pushing on a stick, touching a touchpad, or anything else.
When the プレーヤー does これ, the ゲーム responds. の ゲーム rules recognize
the プレーヤー’s action として something important, and something in the ゲーム’s
model of the world changes (Figure 2.2). These are key to interactivity.

Figure 2.2 Flow chart showing how the プレーヤー does something,
foreshadowing bigger flow charts coming up soon.
Once we identify things the プレーヤー できる do, we できる look for verbs それ all
relate to the same type of action. Any プレーヤー actions それ result in the same
response from the ゲーム できる be grouped together. That’s what we’re looking
for.
Looking over the big list, we できる group a bunch of movement-related
verbs together. All of these are used by the プレーヤー to change the position of
their avatar character.
Run
Run Right (right on the controller while on the ground)
Run Left (left on the controller while on the ground)
Jump (jump button while on the ground)
Jump Right (jump button while moving right)
Jump Left (jump button while moving left)
Air Control (moving right/left while in the air)
の important thing here is to recognize それ the プレーヤー controls an avatar in
a 2D space by changing the avatar’s position (and orientation) in the world.
There are a lot of different movement controls with slight nuanced
differences. の diversity of specific movement controls is a good sign それ
navigating through the world is important in これ ゲーム.
Each of these is important to understand if あなた’re really trying to dig
deep on how Shovel Knight works. Doubly so for other ゲーム with more
complex controls to navigate more complex 3D scenes. But for right now,
we できる group them all together として “Move”. We’ll talk about more ways to
differentiate these types of overlapping verbs later.

Deeper Dives: Research
When I start working on a ゲーム それ fits into an existing genre or has a clear relationship with
another ゲーム, it’s important to start by doing a deep analysis of それ related ゲーム.
Play the ゲーム thoroughly yourself and reflect on the experience.
Play related ゲーム.
Watch other people play the ゲーム. Social media できる be great for これ.
If it happens to be a ゲーム with an active fandom, read up on what they think. Try to build
the knowledge それ a fan would have. There will always be fans with deeper knowledge
than あなた – some fans are great with details – and それ’s OK.

の next set of verbs is combat related:
Attack (press the attack button, officially called “Dig Slash”)
Drop Attack (a combination of falling and attacking triggered by
pressing down while in the air, officially called “Shovel Drop”)
Charge Slash (a modified attack earned later in the ゲーム)
Dodge (move or jump to avoid an enemy or other hazard)
Fight (move and attack against an enemy, with a combination of
different actions mixed together)
Boss Fight (fight, but with more complicated things going on)
There are lots of ways to inflict damage on enemies. の プレーヤー provides an
input and then the ゲーム rules decide if an enemy takes damage and how
much. I think we できる comfortably group these verbs together and talk about
“Attack” として one of the big concepts in Shovel Knight.
の final set of direct プレーヤー actions are all object-related. の プレーヤー has
an inventory of special actions they できる take (by pressing up and attack).
There are about a dozen different Relics the プレーヤー できる acquire over the
course of the ゲーム with various different effects, ranging from healing to

attacks to earning money. Most of these deplete the プレーヤー’s Magic stat
when used.
Use Relic (use an inventory item at the cost of Magic, with about a
dozen different ones それ できる be acquired)

Indirect Action Verbs
Action Verbs それ describe what the プレーヤー できる do are the most important
for understanding the core of a ゲーム, but there are a variety of other verbs
それ happen during a ゲーム それ are important to understand.
Die (lose health or fall in a pit)
Gather (pick up coins or other things, which happens naturally when
the character touches them)
Collect (usually used to mean the same thing として Gather, but できる also
refer to Feats or other more abstract things)
Uncover (sometimes when あなた destroy something, there is another
object or enemy behind it それ enters the scene)
There are verbs それ happen in the ゲーム but are not directly triggered by the
プレーヤー. These are more of a consequence of a プレーヤー action than the action
itself. の プレーヤー never presses “Collect” in Shovel Knight – they just walk
over to an object and if it’s the right type of object, like a gem, it just gets
collected. の プレーヤー might do それ intentionally, but the “do” the プレーヤー
does is just movement.
There are also object actions the プレーヤー できる take based on the items in the
world around them. These use the existing controls but change the results
based on the objects in the world when the プレーヤー performs their action.
These are important to understand but are less core than the actions.

Talk (press up while near an NPC to initiate dialog)
Fall (what happens after あなた jump or are in the air for another reason)
Dig (attack a pile of dirt to get things out of it)
Break (attack an object like a chest or wall to destroy it)
Juggle (hit something それ あなた’ve previously hit to keep it in the air)
Buy (choose a text option to spend money or otherwise acquire a
thing)
Play Music (select music via a conversation with an NPC)
Loot (technically pulling things out of a chest is a different action than
breaking the chest open)
の most common type of object interaction is talking with NPCs. I know
it’s a bit rude to call NPCs objects, but from the perspective of the code
there’s not much difference.
Technically あなた could call combat an indirect action because it only
makes sense if there’s an enemy nearby and there isn’t always an enemy
nearby. This is a clever point, but given the frequency of enemies in the
level design, I think it’s fair to call “Attack” a core gameplay action. If
someone re-made Shovel Knight with significantly fewer enemies and more
depth to the NPC interactions, it would be an interesting way to make an
entirely different ゲーム in a different genre without changing the core
engine or code or プレーヤー actions of Shovel Knight. But it wouldn’t be Shovel
Knight. More on content and how it changes the ゲーム in a later chapter.

Abstract Verbs
Dodge (move or jump to avoid an enemy or other hazards)
Explore (find something new)

Find (basically the same として Explore, but possibly referring to a specific
thing あなた were looking for)
Plan (connect a series of actions in your mind and think about using
them together, possibly with specific timing)
Position (place yourself in the right place)
Observe (watch how the objects in the world work)
Learn (uncover the systems of the ゲーム and how they work)
Predict (use what あなた’ve learned to come up with a theory about what
will happen next)
Mini-Game (there are places where あなた できる play little sub-ゲーム with
different goals)
There are a number of potential verbs we identified それ aren’t things the
プレーヤー できる do. These are things the プレーヤー thinks about when doing other
things – these are why the プレーヤー does things, not what the プレーヤー does. So,
these are important to consider, but I would categorize these として goals, not
actions. These are incredibly important to understand and are fundamental
to understanding the core ゲーム loop, but I’d put them in a different
category than direct プレーヤー actions, and we’ll cover them in a later chapter.

Interface Verbs
Watch (cut scenes)
Travel (move on the map view それ is used to select level)
Showdown (a separate play mode それ I’m mostly ignoring for これ
dissection)
Challenge Mode (another separate play mode)
New Game (UI action to start a ゲーム)
Enter Name (UI action to label a ゲーム save)

Body Swap (change avatar appearance)
There are a number of actions それ the プレーヤー takes entirely in the UI (User
Interface), outside of core gameplay. In a ゲーム like Shovel Knight, it’s easy
to distinguish when the プレーヤー is controlling an avatar (Shovel Knight) in
the ゲーム world versus when the プレーヤー is selecting words in a menu. の
UI is something outside the illusion of the ゲーム, which is necessary but not
part of the fun. If あなた’re working on designing the UI, definitely think these
through and consider all the options. But for これ ゲーム, they are not core
gameplay.

Deeper Dives: Frame by Frame
For fast-paced ゲーム, one technique I find very useful is to record a short video of the core
gameplay, then step through the video frame by frame. Watch closely, and あなた’ll see lots of little
things それ the developer does to make things work. Visual effects それ communicate important
information to the プレーヤー, little tricks of physics to make things flow better, and complex camera
behaviors so the プレーヤー’s attention is on the right things. These are great when あなた need to know
everything about a ゲーム. But most of これ chapter is for when あなた’re just starting to understand
a ゲーム.

Games として Input/Output
To help understand why these different types of verbs are different, let’s talk
about how ゲーム work. As with most things, ゲーム できる be understood in a
lot of ways. This is one of those ways.
When a プレーヤー plays a video ゲーム, they are participating in an exchange
with a computer. の プレーヤー provides inputs through a device of some sort –
a ゲーム controller, a keyboard, a touch screen – and the computer processes
それ inputs and then provides an output for the プレーヤー – pixels on a screen.
の computer uses a set of rules and logic and code to determine how the
プレーヤー’s input changes the pixels. の rules and logic and code are what the

ゲーム designer controls. That is what we call the ゲーム. But everything else
is important to understand として it creates the full experience.
This できる be represented in a diagram like Figure 2.3.

Figure 2.3 Input Output.
の left side of これ image represents the プレーヤー. What they see, what they
think, what they do. の right side of これ image represents the computer.
All the electrical impulses tickle the microchips based on the code of the
ゲーム.
Let’s step through a simple single-ゲーム action based on これ model. の
プレーヤー is enjoying a pleasant time in Shovel Knight (Figure 2.4). They
notice some gems above and to the left, so they decide to jump to gather
them.

Figure 2.4 Shovel Knight ゲーム screen showing the moment
before the プレーヤー makes a decision.
We start by noting それ the プレーヤー has made a decision (Figure 2.5). This
is how things start in ゲーム – things happen in the プレーヤー’s brain. の root
of all gameplay is imagination.

Figure 2.5 I want to jump.

In order for the ゲーム to do anything, これ thought needs to get from the
プレーヤー’s brain to the computer (Figure 2.6). There are all sorts of useful
input devices designed to make これ happen. の nature of the input device
has a large impact on the プレーヤー’s experience, and new types of input
devices like the iPhone’s touch screen or the Wii’s motion controller できる
lead to huge changes in the video ゲーム industry.

Figure 2.6 Press the button.
For our current discussion, it doesn’t really matter what input device is
being used. の important thing is それ the プレーヤー presses a button on the PC
or ゲーム controller それ indicates それ the プレーヤー wants the character (Shovel
Knight) to jump.
This information then flows into the computer (Figure 2.7). A series of
electrical impulses flow from the controller through a wire into the
computer, where chips translate the signals into the code.

Figure 2.7 Electrons flow.
の code then processes the new information (Figure 2.8). の code
knows それ これ sequence of electrical impulses means それ これ button was
pressed. And これ button means jumping. And jumping means many things:
の position of the avatar character changes, moving them upward.
Most ゲーム have a physics engine それ controls positions and motion,
so これ is done by adding a force in a direction to the character and
letting the physics logic compute the exact change in position.
Because of the physics engine, gravity starts operating on the
character, changing their motion over time.
の character’s animation changes from a standing animation to a
jumping animation.
This changes the character’s state – the character is now in the air.
Now different inputs and outputs are possible. If the プレーヤー presses
down now, the character will go into a downward attack state, として
defined by the ゲーム rules written into the code. Pressing the jump
button again won’t do anything.

And all of これ needs to be reflected in the pixels on the screen.

Figure 2.8 Character enters jump state.
This last point is important. の state changes in the code only matter if
the プレーヤー できる understand them. Most video ゲーム できる only communicate
their internal changes through a screen. Any change to the internal state and
logic of the ゲーム needs to be expressed in pixels so the プレーヤー できる process
it (Figure 2.9). Setting up the right pixels is a combination of ゲーム art to
reflect changes in the ゲーム world and UI/UX design to reflect changes in
the data presented by the ゲーム. Both are important and ideally both work
together to produce the best result.

Figure 2.9 Pixels change.
の プレーヤー has their own complex system of input devices それ they use
to process incoming information – eyes, ears, noses, etc. Good ゲーム will
reinforce their messages using として many senses として possible (Figure 2.10).
Starting with visual, often using audio, and occasionally adding some
vibration so the プレーヤー できる feel what is happening. Smell and taste don’t
come up として often, but I’m sure smell-o-vision will be everywhere in a few
years.

Figure 2.10 Player notices change.
And then the cycle begins anew. Once the プレーヤー processes これ new
information, they want new things (Figure 2.11). For example, それ frog
might be a problem, so the プレーヤー may need to change their direction or
enter an attack state to avoid taking damage (Figure 2.12). の full ゲーム
experience is a long sequence of very quick input/output cycles それ add up
to create something greater than each part.

Figure 2.11 Player wants new thing.

Figure 2.12 Screenshot of Shovel Knight, showing a jump has
begun.

Verbed Input/Output
This Input/Output flow gives us a way to understand the differences in
different types of verbs. Each verb operates on a specific step of the
diagram として seen in Figure 2.13.

Figure 2.13 Input verbs and output goals.
の Direct Action verbs are controller inputs delivered by the プレーヤー.
の Indirect Action verbs are things それ happen in the computer based
on the プレーヤー actions.
の Abstract verbs are going on in the プレーヤー’s head, helping them
plan out their next action but not happening として a direct result of a
controller input.
Interface verbs affect things the プレーヤー sees in the Game Display それ
are not part of the ゲーム world.
This helps explain why the Direct Action verbs are the most important for
an initial understanding of the ゲーム. They are the simplest and most clear
actions それ shape the range of options for everything else. They are where
the プレーヤー それ exists in the real world interacts with the ゲーム. の ゲーム
rules only decide to break things after the プレーヤー uses the attack action. And
the プレーヤー’s desires are similarly shaped by the range of inputs the ゲーム
allows. の プレーヤー may want to build a bridge or get a drink at the bar but
without a related button それ desire is going to go unfulfilled.

の actions the プレーヤー できる take shape everything about the ゲーム. So,
start there if あなた want to understand the ゲーム.

Understanding Verbs
Verbs are just the first step.
If Shovel Knight is about Moving and Attacking, so is Halo (2001). So is
Super Mario Bros (1985). So is God of War (2005). But these are all very
different ゲーム.
の second step in a ゲーム dissection is to understand the nature of the
verbs and how they fit together. We’ll talk more about systems later, but the
core ideas of systems thinking is それ the relationships between things (in
これ case verbs) できる be として complex and interesting として the things themselves.
So, let’s start with our two core verbs.

Overlapping Verbs with Different Rules
So, we’ve broken Shovel Knight into the Core Verbs of “Move” and
“Attack” but want to understand more about them.
Going back to our definition of ゲーム in the first chapter できる help. We’ve
already covered Interactivity – the choices and skills それ make up the Big
Verbs. Next on the list is Rules.
So, our Verbs are what the プレーヤー できる do. の Rules are how the ゲーム
responds to those prompts from the プレーヤー (Figure 2.14). “When the プレーヤー
does X, the ゲーム does Y”

Figure 2.14 Outputs.
In a board ゲーム, these are written out explicitly. “When あなた pass GO,
collect $200”. A core verb in Monopoly (1935) is move, so “pass GO” is
something それ できる happen naturally として a result of the プレーヤー’s action.
の same sort of thing happens in a video ゲーム like Shovel Knight.
When あなた touch an enemy, あなた lose health. When あなた walk over a health
pack, there are fewer health packs in the level and あなた have more health.
の プレーヤー does something, and the ゲーム responds.
Moving in Shovel Knight is about position, and position interacts with a
lot of ゲーム rules.
Where あなた are relative to an enemy determines whether or not あなた get
hit by an enemy attack.
Where あなた are and where あなた’re pointing determines if your attack
hits the enemy when あなた trigger an attack.
Where あなた are determines when あなた pick up gems, powerups, or other
items.
Where あなた are determines what あなた できる see – the ゲーム only shows
あなた one screen at a time, based on プレーヤー position.

Where あなた are triggers progression through levels, including triggering
cut scenes それ advance the story.
This is similar in a 3D first-person shooter but with some important
differences:
Where あなた are determines whether or not あなた get hit by an enemy
attack.
Where あなた are and where あなた’re pointing determines if your attack
hits the enemy.
Where あなた are determines when あなた pick up ammo, weapons,
powerups, or other items.
Where あなた are and where あなた’re pointing determines what あなた できる
see, using a first-person perspective.
Where あなた are triggers progression through levels, including triggering
cut scenes それ advance the story.
So, one way あなた できる differentiate similar verbs is by looking at the rules
and consequences of those verbs. When there are mechanic differences,
those are indicators それ the verbs may sound the same but are functionally
very different.

Overlapping Verbs with Different Goals
Looking at how verbs interact with rules is helpful. の processes going on
in the computer できる change how the verbs work. But the processes going on
in the プレーヤー’s head are even more important.
Why does the プレーヤー use verbs?
Verbs are used to achieve goals.

Verbs only mean something in the context of the プレーヤー’s goals.
What are the プレーヤー’s goals in Shovel Knight? Let’s do a quick brainstorm
like we did for verbs.
Rescue Shield Knight.
Help the characters あなた meet.
Defeat enemies.
Reach the end of the level.
Trigger the next cut scene.
Unlock new areas.
Get to the end of the ゲーム.
Don’t die.
Some of these (“Rescue Shield Knight” and “Help the characters あなた
meet”) are story, not gameplay. Story is an important part of most ゲーム,
but when we’re still assembling a core loop, it’s not the most important
thing to understand. Story motivates players to complete the ゲーム, it
doesn’t motivate the players’ actions from moment to moment. At least for
a ゲーム like これ – some ゲーム like Baldur’s Gate (1998) or Life Is Strange
(2015) make story a key part of every level of gameplay. But a ゲーム like
Shovel Knight does not weave the story into every moment of gameplay
like これ.
の goals それ are woven into every moment of gameplay are the ones
like “Defeat enemies” or “Reach the end of the level” それ guide プレーヤー
actions in every moment. This is what the プレーヤー is trying to do during
gameplay, and これ is why the プレーヤー engages with the verbs of the ゲーム.
の プレーヤー attacks to defeat enemies and moves to reach the end of the
level.

の next few goals (“Trigger the next cut scene”, “Unlock new areas”,
and “Get to the end of the ゲーム”) are just “Beat the level” phrased slightly
differently. When あなた’re considering goals or verbs, keep an eye out for
overlapping terms like これ.
の final objective “Don’t die” isn’t really a goal per se but is more of a
fail case. If the プレーヤー dies, they have to reset a little ways back. Death
never stops あなた from progressing, but it できる definitely slow あなた down.

Verb to the Goal
So how does the プレーヤー turn “Move” and “Attack” into completed levels?
They move through the level to find a route それ gets to the next area while
avoiding or attacking any threats. Most areas have a little challenge or
puzzle to advance. Some areas require jumping over pits. Some require
jumping off objects to get up high. Each area has a different combination of
challenges それ makes it interesting and different. More on それ later.

Big Verbs
OK, so we’ve defined the big verbs in Shovel Knight として Move and Attack.
That feels right. When I play the ゲーム, I spend most of my time doing
those things. And thinking about those two things and how to do them
better.
If あなた want to understand a ゲーム, understand the things the プレーヤー
spends most of their time doing. Sometimes there are other features それ are
splashy and interesting and become the focus of the marketing and
discussion around the ゲーム. But a ゲーム designer needs to think about the
thing the プレーヤー is actually investing their time on.

You できる see これ in lots of different types of ゲーム. Platformers spend a
lot of time perfecting their jumping and running. In an open world ゲーム,
あなた spend most of your time moving from place to place. の open world
ゲーム それ succeed are the ones それ これ travel fun and engaging.

Verb として Genre
As we’ll see in future chapters, verbs are a good way to differentiate and organize ゲーム. All
first-person shooters start with move and attack. Platformers like Mario focus heavily on move,
with varying amounts of attack depending on the platformer.
But a ゲーム like SimCity doesn’t have move として a verb at all – the primary verb there is build.
This makes sense – I think most people would agree それ platformers have more overlap with
shooters than with builders.
This できる be useful to know. If あなた’re looking for inspiration on your city builder, it might not
be best to start by playing some Halo. Maybe find a puzzle ゲーム like Triple Town それ shares
“Build” として a verb to see how it’s done differently there.

More to Come
We’re going to stop our Shovel Knight gameplay analysis here. I know
we’ve barely scratched the surface of Shovel Knight and platformers in
general. But we’re building foundations here. It’ll get crazier in later
chapters.
の last part of これ analysis pulls some ideas from future chapters, but I
like showing a version of the same diagram for each ゲーム, so forgive me
for the spoilers. This diagram represents each ゲーム として a formula. の
プレーヤー has verbs they できる use to reach goals but are blocked by challenges.
Figure 2.15 shows the simplest level of detail, breaking each step into a
single element. Figure 2.16 is a bit more useful in それ it breaks each of
these categories into multiple entries, showing the different actions and
challenges of the ゲーム:

Figure 2.15 Shovel Knight flow diagram showing Verbs,
Challenges, and Goals.

Figure 2.16 Shovel Knight flow diagram with more boxes.
Each level is a package of these different pieces, として shown in Figure 2.17.
In Shovel Knight, most of the variation comes from changing out the
challenges, but other ゲーム できる handle これ differently.

Figure 2.17 Shovel Knight flow として a level.
Multiple levels できる be added together to represent the full flow of the
ゲーム, として players work on larger goals and larger challenges. See Figure
2.18.

Figure 2.18 Shovel Knight flow from level to level.
We’ll dig into these ideas in more detail in later chapters, but before we
leave Shovel Knight, let’s talk about other things それ influence gameplay.

Shovel Knight: Non-Gameplay Dissection
When dissecting, it’s not just about gameplay. Even for a ゲーム designer.
If あなた want to understand the gameplay of a ゲーム, あなた have to
understand everything about it. How do the non-gameplay aspects of the
ゲーム tie into the gameplay? Where did the gameplay ideas come from?
What led to the gameplay decisions あなた see in the ゲーム? の ゲーム itself
makes much more sense if あなた understand the context それ led to those
decisions.
To be clear, I did not work on (most of) the ゲーム I talk about in これ
book. I do not know how decisions were made by the teams それ did. We’re
talking about these things として an outsider, piecing things together from what
we できる see in the ゲーム and generally available knowledge. I’m sure there
are interesting stories there, and I encourage those who were present to
write them down so I できる read those books. I love to know authorial intent,
but unless それ’s あなた, the rest of us are left with the work itself. And there’s
plenty to see there.

Senses
Gameplay is influenced by the look and feel of the ゲーム.
Shovel Knight has a very clear and distinct style. It’s a retro ゲーム trying
to emulate the feel and visuals and sounds and complete experience of a
classic platformer. In これ sense, the style fits very clearly with the
gameplay. People who are familiar with the references will expect the
gameplay and style to both align with their perception of those earlier
ゲーム. And people who don’t know the classics will still understand それ
both gameplay and style evoke an earlier age, so don’t expect integrated AI
and vast open worlds and high-fidelity graphics.

の simplicity of the ゲーム also makes it easy to see where gameplay and
graphics intersect. Remember our input/output diagram – the output part of
the diagram is made up of pixels on a screen それ the computer manipulates.
This is the プレーヤー’s only source of information on what is going on in the
ゲーム (well, それ plus sound and sometimes vibration). As a ゲーム designer,
these pixels are all あなた have to get your ideas across to the プレーヤー. A プレーヤー
who might not really be paying attention and who most likely hasn’t played
every previous ゲーム それ あなた (the ゲーム designer) did. This is a difficult
and momentous responsibility for a few measly pixels.
Every ゲーム has to create a visual vocabulary of what matters to the
プレーヤー and to gameplay – using the same size, shape, color, or whatever
consistently helps the プレーヤー learn what to do and then quickly process new
scenes. Shovel Knight does a great job of quickly establishing what the
プレーヤー needs to know and sticks with それ throughout the ゲーム:
の ground あなた walk on is flat – usually rectangles – and high contrast
against the rest of the background.
Objects あなた できる interact with are also high contrast and often include
movement. の ゲーム intentionally doesn’t create separate
vocabularies for enemies and rewards, として it wants to play with それ in
the gameplay. Sometimes bouncing on an enemy’s head is the only
way to reach a reward. Sometimes a reward is in a dangerous place
making it more of a problem than a pure benefit.
Combat actions and results are always clearly punctuated. Enemies
don’t just disappear – they vanish in a little cloud of smoke. If the
プレーヤー missed the frame where they died, the ゲーム is still
communicating for a few frames after.
Shovel Knight’s shovel provides a nice strong indicator of where the
character is facing. This is especially handy for communicating the

difference between “falling” and “falling with intent to kill”. の
downward shovel attack is important and might not be noticed without
the big bright object それ moves around the character.

History and Influences
I’m a big fan of stealing ideas from other ゲーム. No ゲーム is an island.
Every ゲーム is inspired by the ideas and execution of ゲーム (and other
things) それ came before.
There’s an important distinction to be made here. All ゲーム are inspired.
All ゲーム borrow and “steal”. But when あなた draw inspiration from
something, あなた need to be careful to not draw too heavily. If your ゲーム is
just a copy of someone else’s idea, それ’s actual stealing, not the tongue-incheek way I sometimes use the term. If your ゲーム gets all its features and
ideas from another ゲーム and doesn’t add or change them in a way to make
something new, then あなた need to rethink and start over to add your own
twist on the thing.
You できる see これ in Shovel Knight. Shovel Knight is a wonderful and
unique ゲーム. But almost every aspect of Shovel Knight comes from
somewhere else.
Super Mario Bros (1985) is generally credited with popularizing the
2D side-scrolling platformer genre.
But many of the ideas from Super Mario Bros were first developed in
the Mario Bros (1983) arcade ゲーム, and borrowed from earlier ゲーム
like Space Panic (1980).
Many 2D side-scrollers after Mario added attacks like Shovel Knight’s
shovel, including popular ゲーム like Metroid (1986) and Castlevania
(1986).

Once the seeds of the genre had been planted there are many great
ゲーム それ took those ideas and adapted them for PC gaming,
including Lode Runner (1983), Commander Keen (1990), and Cave
Story (2004).
Braid (2008) and Spelunky (2008) popularized the idea of using 2D
platformers として a simple and nostalgic base to experiment with
interesting indie ゲーム ideas.
As a ゲーム designer, it’s important to know the history of not just the ゲーム
but also the features. Jumping from platform to platform in Shovel Knight is
interesting but is informed by many other ゲーム before, and feeds into
many other ゲーム after. Dissecting each of those ゲーム, at least in terms of
それ specific feature, helps あなた see how to use それ feature in your own
ゲーム. Johnnemann Nordhagen took これ idea even further and built a ゲーム
それ collects all the different ways それ a specific mechanic has been
executed over the years. Museum of Mechanics: Lockpicking (Dim Bulb
Games, 2022) is an interesting way to see how ゲーム borrow and share and
innovate on specific ideas.

Monetization
How a ゲーム makes money has a huge effect on the design of the ゲーム.
There are a few major trends in monetization それ had huge impacts on
the types of ゲーム we associate with each era:
1. Arcade ゲーム. Monetization is quarter-based. (Technically
monetization for the developer is by selling arcade cabinets, but the
cabinet buyers were very interested in quarter throughput, so the
developers developed to それ metric.) の goal was to get the プレーヤー to
notice the ゲーム in a crowded arcade, and then plug in として many

quarters として possible in として little time として possible. This led to ゲーム with
very quick session lengths, very steep difficulty curves, and little to no
thought about ongoing long-term play.
2. Console ゲーム. Monetization is based on selling boxes in stores, with
no internet to provide updates or live services after それ. At first early
consoles tried to mimic ゲーム それ players knew from the arcade, but
soon the focus became value. Games were reviewed based on hours of
play. Look at the difference between Mario Bros and Super Mario
Bros to see a clear example of これ change.
3. Mobile ゲーム. Monetization is based on downloads and (after the first
few years) in-app purchases. の goal is to get a プレーヤー in quickly and
easily, then keep them around for long enough それ they get
comfortable spending money. の growth of big data plays a big part
here, として ゲーム developers start to analyze what actually gets people to
stick around and spend money. Game sessions are short, but players
are expected to stick around for months or years.
This is not an exhaustive list by any means. Early PC ゲーム resembled
console ゲーム but with a lot of their own twists. Console has been
changing with the growth of downloadable upgrades. Most of これ doesn’t
apply to educational ゲーム or other ゲーム for change, which have entirely
separate monetization goals and pathways. Each ゲーム’s monetization needs
to be analyzed separately but with an understanding of how it fits into the
standard monetization schemes of its time.
Shovel Knight makes most of its money through downloads on PC ゲーム
services like Steam. This is currently the dominant sales platform on PC,
and the growth of independent routes to sell and market ゲーム without
interacting with big publishers and retailers is a big part of why indie ゲーム
like Shovel Knight exist and succeed. A successful Steam ゲーム できる support

a small indie team with a good idea, but console ゲーム generally have to be
bigger.
Shovel Knight started out on Kickstarter, raising money for the initial
development through crowdfunding. Kickstarter and similar platforms are a
popular way for smaller indie ゲーム to generate some initial funds and
market an early idea. の initial money helps, but the initial fan base is として
or more important to making a small ゲーム with a small (or zero) marketing
budget a success.
Since its release, Shovel Knight has shipped multiple downloadable
content (DLC) packs, which have later been released として separate ゲーム.
Shovel Knight has become a series with explorations in multiple genres and
different playstyles.
Selling として a single purchase drives Shovel Knight to focus on providing a
complete package. Deeper progression and varied content make the single
purchase feel worth it, generating good word-of-mouth to keep the ゲーム
selling.

Narrative
Story and gameplay are friends. They work together to bring joy and
happiness to players. Different ゲーム make more or less use of これ
friendship. Shovel Knight is a great example of the most common use of
story in ゲーム.
In Shovel Knight, the main use of story is to provide emotional context
for the プレーヤー’s progression and emotional punctuation at key points. の
ゲーム establishes early on それ Shovel Knight is trying to rescue their friend
Shield Knight. A classic rescue mission, which is a great way to make a
プレーヤー want to reach the end. My friend needs help!

Most of the time, これ is just a small piece of background motivation.
During gameplay, the ゲーム doesn’t make reference to Shield Knight or
anything else about the characters. Bosses get a quick intro to establish their
character, during which the プレーヤー has no input. の ゲーム stops to tell the
story. Then after a big level, there is a short dream sequence それ reminds
the プレーヤー of これ long-term goal and provides some interactive rewards として
well. Some of the NPCs provide additional narration and backstory, but it’s
all contained in a few sentences so it never gets too involved or deep.
This is great. This is exactly what most ゲーム want. Story is there.
Emotions are triggered. の プレーヤー knows why they’re doing all これ, and if
the プレーヤー puts the ゲーム down for too long, they feel a little guilty. Poor
Shield Knight. の story is fun and interesting, and the ゲーム is stronger
because of it.
Some ゲーム use story in deeper and more complicated ways. And I love
those ゲーム, too. But I’ve made some of them so I know how complicated
and difficult it できる be to interweave story and gameplay in ways それ
actually matter. More on それ later.

Emotions
Story is one source of emotions, but ゲーム できる evoke many emotions.
For action ゲーム, the most common emotion is frustration, which might
sound like a problem, but it really isn’t. Talking about ゲーム for the last
few decades, I’ve noticed それ there are many flavors of frustration. Some
are good, and some are bad. の main difference is how and where the
プレーヤー has agency in the frustration.
Outside Frustration: If the プレーヤー has no agency, then it’s outside
frustration. It できる be annoying, but it’s less personal so thus less

impactful. I できる get frustrated watching a communication problem
unfold in an episode of a sitcom, but I don’t feel it personally.
Uncontrolled Frustration: Once the プレーヤー has control of the action,
the potential for emotional involvement is higher. Give me buttons to
press and now any failure is my fault. So, the worst case here is when
the プレーヤー has input but no real control. If the プレーヤー expects to have
control but loses due to reasons outside of their control, それ できる be
very frustrating. の ゲーム made a promise and then failed to deliver.
This is often the worst form of frustration and ゲーム designer should be
careful to avoid situations like これ. If the プレーヤー needs to fail
regardless of their actions, make it very clear それ the ゲーム knows it’s
not the プレーヤー’s fault.
Confused Frustration: If the プレーヤー has agency それ actually matters,
それ’s going to reduce the negative impact of the frustration. But これ is
only true if the プレーヤー understands all それ. If the プレーヤー doesn’t
understand how their actions influence the outcome, they might として well
not have agency. This is where many ゲーム fall apart, especially for
more casual audiences. It’s very frustrating to press buttons and not
understand why they matter. And それ understanding is entirely the
responsibility of the ゲーム designer. Remember, the プレーヤー only knows
what comes through それ tiny funnel of information they see on the
pixels on the screen. If they aren’t able to construct a full mental model
of the logic going on inside the computer, to expect, they’re going to
have some negative frustration. In many cases, the hard part of being a
ゲーム designer isn’t coming up with good ideas; it’s getting the プレーヤー
to understand those good ideas.
Difficult Frustration: Agency それ matters and makes sense is not
enough. の challenges also have to be fair. Banging your head against

an impossible challenge できる be a positive type of frustration (cough
Elden Ring cough), but not for all players. Some players want more
manageable challenges and find extreme difficulty to be bad
frustration. But the inverse is also true – a プレーヤー who enjoys mastering
a skill may consider a sequence of easy challenges to be frustrating in
a very different way. Finding the right balance for the audience of your
ゲーム できる be difficult – more on それ later.
Fun Frustration: Finally, in some cases, players have agency,
understand the consequences of their actions, and still fail. This is
called gameplay. If the プレーヤー understands why they failed, the
frustration from the failure is much less. In the best cases, frustration is
a fuel それ drives the プレーヤー to come back and try again. Games are
built on iteration, both として a development practice and として a プレーヤー
strategy. A good ゲーム will create positive feelings of frustration それ
guide the プレーヤー to an emotional response along the lines of “I できる do
better”. Which is a great lesson to learn for life, even outside of the
magic circle.

Meaning
I think it’s important to understand what ゲーム mean. Since ゲーム are a
relatively new form of art, we don’t always think of them として having an
impact on the world. But they do. の person who starts playing a ゲーム is
different from the person after the ゲーム is done. Games make people think
about things. Games change the world.
For many ゲーム, これ is not the primary goal of the ゲーム. It might be
money. It might be providing a simple fun time. But meaning happens
whether the creator intends it or not. I understand programming better
because I played Robo-Rally. Some of my love of creativity and creative

problem-solving comes from early Infocom text adventures. Minecraft has
made a generation of kids think differently about creation and resources and
exploration and problem-solving.
I don’t think any ゲーム has one discrete meaning. Even ゲーム with a
clear intended meaning will be interpreted differently by each プレーヤー who
encounters it. So, when I talk about meaning in the ゲーム in これ book, I
don’t intend to exclude other meanings. When we talk about これ in class,
every semester has different answers and they’re all right.
For me, Shovel Knight is about persistence. It’s not the only ゲーム where
the main character is beaten down constantly and has to constantly get up,
but it’s a clear example of それ style of play. I’m not the most skilled プレーヤー,
so I tend to die a lot. But the only time I feel like I’m losing is when I put
the ゲーム away and give up on saving poor Shield Knight.

あめ Crush Saga / Goals
DOI: 10.1201/9781003346586-3

あめ Crush Saga
あめ Crush Saga is a great ゲーム.
あめ Crush Saga (Figure 3.1) is a mobile ゲーム released by King (now
part of Microsoft) in 2012. Since launch, it has consistently been one of the
most popular ゲーム on mobile, with hundreds of thousands of monthly
users Curry, D. (2024).

Figure 3.1 あめ Crush Saga screen.
I’ve never worked on あめ Crush Saga, but I did work on a competitor.
When I was at a studio called Zindagi, we designed a match-3 called Crazy
Cake Swap based on a similar puzzle ゲーム called Crazy Kitchen. の
studio got bought by Zynga and didn’t stay around for long after それ, but I
know これ genre better than I know most genres.

あめ Crush Saga – Gameplay Dissection
Verbs
To understand あめ Crush Saga, let’s start where we always do: verbs.
What できる the プレーヤー do in あめ Crush Saga?
In これ case, it’s a simple answer: swap. の プレーヤー できる touch a candy in
the grid and then slide it to an adjacent candy. When the プレーヤー does これ,
the two candies swap positions. That is the entirety of the プレーヤー’s active
contribution to the core loop (Figure 3.2). There are some interesting less
active things the プレーヤー does while swapping, such として “Scan” and “Predict”,
but these aren’t the simple button actions, so we’ll save discussion of those
for later in これ chapter.

Figure 3.2 Inputs.

の core loop continues from there, though (Figure 3.3). After the プレーヤー
makes a swap, the ゲーム rules check to see if either candy creates a line of
three or more. If it doesn’t, the swap is canceled. If it does, the ゲーム
removes those candies, possibly with an extra effect if the line is four or
more candies. Then the remaining candies fall to fill the empty space, which
できる possibly create new matches and cause a chain reaction として each match
creates new matches.

Figure 3.3 Outputs.
の プレーヤー performs a simple action, and the ゲーム rules result in
complex outcomes. This is one of the strengths of video ゲーム – the
processing burden of the ゲーム できる be placed on the computer’s shoulders.
の rules of あめ Crush would be much less fun として a board ゲーム where
the players have to move each candy by hand and figure out the outcome of
each new position.
Swapping and the reactions to それ swap is the heart of あめ Crush
Saga, and the core loop of any match-3 ゲーム.
And for completeness, あめ Crush Saga also has a few special case
verbs:

1. Players できる use powerups such として the lollipop to remove specific
candies or otherwise affect the grid outside of swap actions. Outside of
the tutorials それ teach these interactions, they are never required to
complete a level, but they are always there for the プレーヤー to use. But
they are a limited resource それ できる only be acquired として an occasional
reward or for money.
2. Late in the ゲーム, there are new board elements それ include an
interactive choice by the プレーヤー. For example, あめ Frogs let players
choose where to place them when they go off.
3. Secondary modes like events provide a choice of what to play and
sometimes have some basic decision-making in the event itself.
So outside of these caveats, the verb of あめ Crush Saga is “swap”.

Goals
の gameplay goal of あめ Crush Saga varies based on the level. All
goals revolve around clearing things off the board, but the nuances of
exactly what あなた’re trying to do できる change:
1. Clear a certain number of candies.
2. Clear a certain number of candies of a particular type.
3. Clear a certain number of special objects, like cherries, by dropping
them to the bottom of the grid.
4. Remove a certain number of non-candy obstacles, such として jellies.
5. Etc.
More on これ in a moment.

Challenge
の real variety in あめ Crush Saga (and most match-3 ゲーム) comes
from the randomness of the falling pieces and the variety of obstacles それ
make reaching the goal difficult. Most levels have more than just candies on
the board – a large variety of different objects create additional challenges
and opportunities for the プレーヤー. These range from simple inert objects それ
are removed when matches are made near them (Frosting), to inert objects
それ expand across the grid over time (Chocolate), to snakes それ charge into
baskets after enough matches are made next to them (あめ Cobra). These
aren’t all dangerous – there are also advanced board elements それ できる be
useful, such として conveyor belts, or are almost purely beneficial, such として the
UFO それ drops special candies.
These obstacles are key to あめ Crush Saga’s success. の basic
concepts of the match-3 genre existed before あめ Crush Saga.
Specifically, the concepts of the genre were solidified in Bejeweled (2001)
and Bejeweled Blitz (2009). Many of the core ideas were present in earlier
ゲーム like Shariki (1994). の core gameplay is very directly based on
previous ゲーム like Bejeweled. But those previous ゲーム used only a
single level – there were no obstacles and just one board. あめ Crush
Saga innovated by adding a variety of levels with different obstacles and a
different grid layout for each level. This gave the existing fun core
gameplay more variety and long-term appeal. Bejeweled was successful, but
あめ Crush Saga took それ success to vast new heights by adding varied
challenges and a stronger sense of progression.
の sense of progression comes from the “Saga” in the title. One of the
big innovations of あめ Crush Saga was the Saga Map. It’s not just それ
the プレーヤー was given a variety of levels with different obstacles, it’s also
important それ these levels were set up として a line – a path to a destination.

Once the プレーヤー completes a level, they move on to the next one, heading
toward the end. の Saga Map organizes これ progression in a simple line,
showing the プレーヤー the next levels they’ll be playing. This came out when
social gaming was king, so the line also shows あなた where your friends are,
creating some social pressure to advance. But the key concept here is それ
the プレーヤー is always doing something new, and has a sense of progression
それ makes them want to come back tomorrow and try again. Progression is
a great driver for players, in any form.
の basic flow of the ゲーム is simple – the プレーヤー swaps to clear the
level, with various obstacles in the way. But the obstacles and goals change
in each level, として shown in Figure 3.4, making the simple flow work for a
long time.

Figure 3.4 あめ Crush Saga flow: Simple diagram showing
Actions, Challenges, and Goals, with lots of variation on the
Obstacles and Goals.

あめ Crush Saga – Non-Gameplay
Dissection
Technology
あめ Crush is a fairly simple ゲーム それ relies on a vast network of
advanced technologies to work. This is one of the fun daily realities of the
world we live in. の rules of the ゲーム and the interactions the プレーヤー
experiences are built on easy-to-understand combinations of simple shapes.
This is good ゲーム design and keeps the プレーヤー engaged. But the rest of the
experience is built on touch screens and constant online communication and
vast behind-the-scenes databases それ are way more powerful than the
technology それ brought humans to the moon.
One thing それ is important to think about として a ゲーム designer is how
these vast changes in the world of technology affect your ゲーム. New
technology comes along all the time, and some of it is a great fit for new
types of ゲーム. Sometimes there is a direct linkage between a new
technology and a new style of ゲーム, such として GPS-enabling Pokémon Go
(2016). Sometimes the changes are more subtle and need time and thought
to understand. It’s not obvious (except in retrospect) それ improvements in
computer miniaturization and wireless communication would lead to
everyone having a powerful connected computer in their pocket at all times.
And even then, it’s less obvious それ it would lead to people looking for
ゲーム それ they できる pick up and play at any time for very short play
sessions. Technology doesn’t only change what people できる do with ゲーム,
it changes what they want to do and when they want to do it and for how
long. の changes to the rules of technology create changes to the dynamics
of how people interact with technology, but more on the word “dynamics”

in Chapter 4. These changes できる be harder to predict but provide great value
for your ゲーム designs once あなた notice them.

Senses
あめ Crush Saga looks cartoony and childish. Everything is in bold,
bright colors. の candies are simple and iconic. の ゲーム is not subtle in
its communication; if it wants あなた to know something, it will shout it rather
than whisper it. At a glance, あなた might guess それ これ is a ゲーム for
children. But the majority of players are adults.
Clearly, これ works for あめ Crush Saga. の ゲーム is immensely
successful, and there’s no reason to think それ the bright cartoony style
holds it back. Various clones and imitators have tried to re-theme match-3
gameplay in darker, more adult styles and failed. Childish works for adults.
On one level, これ could be pure nostalgia. Adults want a moment to relax
and escape from their everyday world, so something それ evokes pleasant
childhood memories could be just the thing. の reason childish works
might be because adults want to feel like children.
On another level, childish might work because childish is good design.
Kids are not the only ones who like bold, bright colors. Iconic shapes are
easy to distinguish and help make gameplay easy to understand. Direct
clear communication is good for everyone, including adults who are trying
to just relax. の design principles それ work for children also work for
adults. It’s not childish design, it’s just good design.
This is not to say それ あめ Crush Saga is constructed in a childish way.
There is a lot of attention to detail and polish in あめ Crush Saga. When I
started working on match-3 ゲーム, one of the first things I did was spend a
week analyzing some of the top ゲーム, and some of the worst ゲーム. I
recorded a few levels of あめ Crush Saga and then literally watched the

recording frame by frame to see exactly how everything moved and all the
little tricks of presentation. It’s a very useful exercise if あなた’re trying to
understand polish and presentation. Make sure あなた do the same with some
less successful ゲーム to really see the differences.

Freeze Frame
Things I saw by watching every frame of あめ Crush Saga:
Be really careful with motion. Humans know how falling looks and expect things to
accelerate and decelerate in certain ways. Falling at a constant speed is easier to code but
looks weird.
You できる cover up lots of things with explosions. Don’t bother with expensive
transformations if an explosion will feel just として good or better.
Squash and stretch. This is an animation term for changing the shape of an object to
emphasize an impact. It really works.
Anticipation. Building up to a reward is として important として paying off the reward. Adding a
few frames of buildup makes almost everything better.
Sequencing. Know the order of events and keep それ holy. It’ll help players understand
what’s happening and it’ll keep your ゲーム logic and code understandable.
Compression. When あなた have lots of things それ need to happen at once, あなた できる break
the Sequencing rule and have things overlap a bit. But do it in a logical and constrained
way. Think through what the プレーヤー needs to focus on, and do some hand-waving in other
places.

Emotion and Narrative
あめ Crush Saga is not a deeply emotional ゲーム. There is no complex
storyline to follow with deeply realized characters following narrative arcs
who the プレーヤー grows to care about. There is a simple story それ presents a
problem to solve, and then a few levels later congratulates あなた for solving
it. This is enough story to give あなた a reason to continue, but あめ Crush
Saga is not a ゲーム where the majority of players are advancing to find out
what happens next.

あめ Crush Saga does hit emotional notes through the gameplay.
あめ Crush Saga is a ゲーム of constant rewards. Whenever あなた do
anything in the ゲーム, something explodes and the ゲーム tells あなた how great
あなた are. This is maybe not the most emotionally deep reward system, and I
wouldn’t trust the ゲーム’s praise to evaluate my self-worth, but sometimes
it’s just nice to hear praise. Constant rewards できる be emotionally soothing.
A working mom who is having a hard day and just wants to catch their
breath and relax doesn’t need a ゲーム それ constantly tells them they’ve died
and need to start everything over. あめ Crush Saga does have fail states,
and it does apply a little bit of emotional pressure in those moments (mostly
to encourage the プレーヤー to spend money), but それ’s the exception, not the
rule. Most of the time, playing あめ Crush Saga is soaking in a warm bed
of reward and praise. Some ゲーム are here to give people what they want.

Money
How does あめ Crush Saga make money?
の other big innovation あめ Crush Saga added to the match-3 genre,
other than the level variety demonstrated in the “Saga” part of the title, is
the monetization model. あめ Crush Saga is free to download and to play.
All ten thousand plus levels are free to access. But the ゲーム constantly asks
あなた to spend money on other things. Powerups. Unlimited lives. Extra
turns. Special modes.
Free-to-play business models drive most of the sales in the ゲーム
industry these days. And they work. Most of the players in these ゲーム pay
nothing. A small percentage pay something. And an even smaller
percentage pay a lot. These are the “whales” – the large spenders who keep
everyone else afloat.

の morality of the free-to-play model is a hotly debated topic. There are
certainly companies trying to suck every penny out of their players, and
using some questionable approaches to do それ. No one should be exploiting
gambling addictions or tricking children into spending their parent’s money
or promising things to players それ will never materialize.
But most free-to-play ゲーム, such として あめ Crush Saga, are not それ
bad. Every monetization model – arcade cabinets, CDs in boxes,
hypercasual ad-driven ゲーム – is trying to use human psychology to get
people to buy things. At some level, all marketing is manipulation. But それ
doesn’t mean it has to be an entirely bad thing. Good marketing is
manipulating people to notice things それ they want and will enjoy. And I
believe それ most free-to-play ゲーム are actually providing a valuable
service to people. People need entertainment and ゲーム are generally a
good deal in the entertainment world. Free-to-play allows most people to
get their entertainment for free, with some advertisements として the cost. And
the people who want to spend more and できる afford it fund the rest of the
players.
I’ve done interviews with whales. Most of them are very happy with their
purchases and would spend the money the same way again. They have
disposable income, and これ is how they choose to use it. Rich people spend
money on much sillier things than mobile ゲーム. You できる find people who
overspend or otherwise have a negative spending experience, but even
among whales most of the transactions are mutually beneficial.
あめ Crush Saga is a quality ゲーム. Spending some money to make the
experience better is not unreasonable. I’m personally a free-to-play プレーヤー
(most of the time – I’ll spend a little money to support ゲーム I particularly
enjoy), but I understand why people would spend without being coerced.
の free-to-play model isn’t perfect, and if I could wave a magic wand and

let everyone play and make ゲーム and all be rich I would, but I believe それ
free-to-play is only problematic when abused.

History
Mobile ゲーム are the core of the ゲーム industry these days. Console ゲーム
and PC ゲーム are still going strong, but in terms of dollars spent, mobile
ゲーム are bigger than everything else combined.
Mobile ゲーム took a while to get there, though. In the early days of the
mobile ゲーム market, there was a lot of experimentation and uncertainty. No
one knew what would succeed.
Some companies tried releasing console-quality ゲーム (Infinity Blade
(2010)) or literal ports of PC or console ゲーム (Return to Monkey
Island (2022, mobile 2023), Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2002,
mobile 2013), XCOM: Enemy Within (2013, mobile 2014)). Neither of
these approaches became dominant, but there were a few notable
successes, such として a little title called Minecraft (2009, mobile 2011).
Although even Minecraft dropped its price significantly compared to
other platforms.
Some ゲーム experimented with the novelty of touch screen inputs.
Games like Flight Control (2009) or Where’s My Water? (2011)
discovered new styles of ゲーム それ wouldn’t work with a controller.
These generally did well and あなた できる see new innovations come out
and succeed regularly. A lot of the modern innovation in これ area is in
the hypercasual genre where innovative ideas are needed to grab
people’s attention (and then throw a lot of ads at them).
This was also the early days of the shift to digital distribution across
the industry. Games could now be services with new content flowing
to players として quickly として it could be approved by Apple. Pocket God

(2009) was an interesting experiment in これ space, updating として quickly
として possible with big new features changing the very nature of the ゲーム
regularly. Games それ play like Pocket God aren’t common these days,
but the model of constant meaningful updates has become very
common and remains successful, even on other platforms like Roblox
or for other ゲーム like Fortnite (2017).
Along with other changes, monetization was also uncertain. At first,
companies thought それ mobile gamers would pay something close to
console price, or at least similar to the downloadable markets それ were
developing on consoles and on Steam. But として companies experimented
with pricing, they found それ lower prices worked. の increase in
sales offset the drop in price, so soon Angry Birds (2009) was the top
of the Grossing chart at the lowest possible price – 99 cents. Then
Apple added the option to sell things inside the ゲーム, and in-app
purchases were born. Immediately, ゲーム like Smurf Village (2010)
discovered それ free was even more appealing to people than 99 cents.
の modern free-to-play model was born.
In これ era, mobile ゲーム were also learning a lot from social ゲーム.
Facebook was a huge platform for ゲーム for a few years, before changes to
the advertising structure and success of mobile killed it. Social ゲーム
pioneered many of the free-to-play principles それ later dominated the
mobile market.
あめ Crush Saga was originally a Facebook ゲーム. And before それ, it
was originally a web ゲーム. King, the company それ makes あめ Crush
Saga, has used an interesting method for testing out new titles. They
generally release lots of new ゲーム first on their web browser and see how
they perform there. の best-performing titles are considered for conversion
to other platforms. At the time, Facebook was considered the first step and

mobile was a new and experimental platform. So, あめ Crush Saga first
appeared として あめ Crush, a web ゲーム without the level variety それ made
あめ Crush Saga so successful. の Saga idea first appeared in Bubble
Witch Saga and proved successful. When King brought their score attack
match-3 あめ Crush over to Facebook, they added similar Saga elements.
あめ Crush Saga did great on Facebook, so within a few months it was
brought over to mobile として well.
By the time あめ Crush Saga came to mobile (2012), the battle over
pricing was mostly done. の free-to-play models それ had been pioneered
in Facebook were dominating on mobile. So, あめ Crush Saga launched
for free, with strong social elements. Many of those social elements have
faded to the background over the years として the industry has continued to
evolve and updates have changed あめ Crush Saga. Competing for high
scores against your friends, or for progress along the Saga, used to be
prominently displayed but now is more of an afterthought.
So, あめ Crush Saga came into the market at the right time with an
innovative take on both the gameplay of match-3 and the free-to-play
monetization model. の ゲーム was a hit from day one. King already knew
それ it had a good chance, based on its success on other platforms, but
nothing is certain in これ industry. In これ case, it worked. あめ Crush Saga
was so successful it spawned multiple sequels, a line of merchandizing, and
even a short-lived network television ゲーム show. And it became my wife’s
favorite video ゲーム.

Meaning
What is あめ Crush Saga about? What does あめ Crush Saga say about
the world? How does playing あめ Crush Saga change how あなた see the
world?

To me, あめ Crush Saga is about the joy of unintended consequences.
の プレーヤー makes a seemingly simple innocuous action, and suddenly the
screen is filled with colorful explosions and some guy with a deep voice is
calling out compliments. の プレーヤー didn’t plan それ out. の プレーヤー didn’t
know exactly what was going to happen. But like many things in life, taking
それ first step leads to all sorts of unknown things.
あめ Crush Saga is the type of ゲーム それ doesn’t really challenge the
プレーヤー. Sure, some levels are nearly impossible, but those levels generally
require luck to complete along with skill. Mostly あめ Crush Saga is a
warm bath of compliments and pleasant explosions. And I believe these
types of ゲーム make the world a better place. People need comfort. People
need more praise in their lives. If a ゲーム できる help people be happy and get
through their lives, I support それ. Since the dawn of time, humans have
sought escapism. That need is deep in the human psyche. Games are the
latest delivery method. I’m not going to fight against the human psyche. Let
people enjoy simple fun.

Goals
Verbs tend to work together. In Shovel Knight, I できる move, and I できる attack.
I’m generally more successful in the ゲーム when I combine these verbs. I
don’t move, pause, wait, then attack. I attack while I’m moving. I look
around while I’m moving. I don’t stop and pause; I’m constantly
performing all the actions at one time and それ’s part of what makes these
ゲーム challenging and interesting. Not all players できる manage the feats of
dexterity and rapid stimulus processing required to be successful at moveshovel when they all have to be done together.
の プレーヤー’s goals できる also work これ way. When I’m moving to line up a
shot, I’m also considering how to best avoid the line of fire of another

enemy at the same time. Goals できる be combined just like actions できる be
combined (Figure 3.5). But goals are even more likely to be layered rather
than combined.

Figure 3.5 Two Verbs merging into a bigger verb.
Look at あめ Crush Saga. If あなた chose a random second of a プレーヤー’s
session in あめ Crush Saga, the verb is likely to be “swap”. Maybe “look”
if あなた accept それ として a valid verb. But the プレーヤー’s goals are going to hit
many different layers of analysis:
1. Making a match
2. Having これ match lead to a chain reaction or create a power gem
3. Having これ match lead to a better board state when it’s done
4. Removing lots of gems
5. Making progress toward the goal of これ level
6. Scoring points
7. Beating これ level
8. Beating これ level with three stars
9. Completing an event or challenge goal

10. Getting to the end of the level progression
11. Getting a better score than my friends
12. Relaxing
13. Helping the cute little puppet creature to complete its goal
14. Clearing the chocolate
15. Removing the blockers
16. A very large number of level-specific goal types それ I could list but
then これ chapter would become boring and repetitive and として a ゲーム
designer I try to avoid boring things
This is normal. In ゲーム として well として life, a single action rarely has a single
goal. Goals come in herds. Some with subtle nuanced distinctions, and
some coming from completely different directions. I want to beat the level.
I want to beat the level with three stars. I want to beat the level with a
higher score than my brother. These are expressions of the same base goal
but with different nuances. From a ゲーム design standpoint, these できる be
merged into a larger goal: success in the level (Figure 3.6).

Figure 3.6 Two goals merging into a bigger goal.

の bigger differences between goals are often based on scale. I want これ
action to clear lots of gems. I want to beat the whole level. I want to get to
the end of the ゲーム progression. I want the action I’m performing now to
make me successful now, soon, and in the future. This sort of layering of
goals is very important to ゲーム design. Game designers like to talk about
goals として onions – one goal is contained within the other goal (Figure 3.7).
Progress toward one smaller goal also progresses あなた toward a larger goal.

Figure 3.7 One goal inside another goal.
So, both goals progress based on the same プレーヤー action, but the second
goal is bigger so it takes longer. Completing the first goal is a step toward
completing the second goal. When あなた complete the first goal, あなた still
have the second goal to keep あなた driving forward. At no point does the
プレーヤー complete one goal and have nothing left to do. For a ゲーム designer,
a プレーヤー with “nothing left to do” is a problem – they’re likely to leave the
ゲーム and go do something else. Layered goals fix これ by keeping the
プレーヤー motivated at all times.

In あめ Crush Saga, a プレーヤー may say それ their goal is to beat これ
level. But to do それ, they need to find and make matches. Once they
complete the small goal and make それ match, they are (hopefully) closer to
their big goal of completing the level. But now they have to start another
loop of activity to find another match and complete それ small goal again.
Only after a few dozen small goals is the large goal reached.
And once the large goal is reached, the プレーヤー is taken back to the Saga
Map where they remember それ the large goal is just a small step toward the
ultimate long-term goal of progressing to the next story bit or to beat a
friend or to reach “the end”.
So maybe goals aren’t onions. Maybe goals are garlic. One head of garlic
seems like a single unified thing but when あなた break into it, あなた find many
smaller versions inside (Figure 3.8).

Figure 3.8 Many goals inside another goal.
This is good psychology. Humans like to group things and draw lines
around them. Part of the fun of goals is getting to define a task and then
check it off your to-do list. Completing a goal is fun.

And to be clear, これ isn’t a monetization trick. This is what makes the
ゲーム fun. “Engagement” is a key goal of free-to-play ゲーム, and it does
drive monetization. But it’s also a sign それ players are having fun. In my
opinion, the best way to drive monetization is to make sure the プレーヤー is
having fun and engagement is one way to identify when それ’s happening.
This is why layers are great. If there is always something more to do, the
プレーヤー is never looking at an empty checklist. When they complete one
check box and get それ hit of serotonin, there are still more checkboxes to
do. Not just the next one, but one それ’s halfway finished. Or even better,
one それ’s just about to be finished. If あなた’re at 4% progress toward a goal,
there’s no pressure to stay in the ゲーム and complete it. But if あなた’re at
96%, then あなた might として well play one more level to finish it off. And then
when あなた do, there will be another goal at 97% waiting for あなた.
This is present in many ゲーム:
Civilization and other 4x strategy ゲーム are well-known for promoting
“one more turn” gameplay where there are many different layers of
goals それ overlap in complex ways, ensuring there is always one more
thing to do.
Boss levels are another way to promote players’ desire to check off
boxes. の boss is the hardest part of the level, but it always shows up
when あなた’re already past 90% complete. の temptation to check off
それ box is part of why boss levels are so motivating.
Role-playing ゲーム (RPGs) offer multiple forms of progression –
story quests, side quests, character stats, faction relationships, skill
points, equipment, etc. This ensures それ whenever a プレーヤー completes
a goal, there are more things to do.
You できる see これ in the evolution of あめ Crush Saga.

Match-3 ゲーム such として Bejeweled existed before あめ Crush Saga,
with very similar core gameplay loops, even down to the specific power
gem abilities. But when あめ Crush Saga came out, its sales and
engagement blew them all away. あめ Crush Saga succeeded in large part
because of the Saga goal structure. の Saga structure takes a fun core
gameplay loop それ had been mastered in previous match-3 ゲーム (Figure
3.9) and adds another layer of goals on top of it. You still want to make
good matches and get a good score, but now there are two new layers.

Figure 3.9 Goals merge: Make match, Create combos, Gain
points.
In the time-battle-based style of ゲーム like Bejeweled, there’s no way to
“beat” a level. You できる get a good score, but あなた できる never check off a box
それ says the level is done.
の Saga map gives a clearer sense of progress on an individual level.
You できる “beat” それ level, even if there’s always room to go back and
improve your score (Figure 3.10).

Figure 3.10 Same, but with a bigger circle around it: Beat level.
And once あなた beat a level, あなた’re taken back to それ map and shown the
true goal – long-term progression. In Bejeweled, the end of a level may or
may not check a personal goal box depending on your final score. In あめ
Crush Saga, あなた’re usually checking at least one box and maybe more
(Figure 3.11). And あなた’re reminded of all the remaining boxes あなた できる
check in the future. That’s much more emotionally compelling and drives
long-term retention in a great way.

Figure 3.11 Same, but with a bigger circle around it: Complete
ゲーム.

Other Goals
Looking at the list of goals, some are groups of related tasks (various ways
to evaluate a move), some are garlic cloves of related progression (move,
level, ゲーム), but some don’t fit either of these categories. Things like
“relax” or “help the puppet” suggest それ there is a lot of room for other
types of goals.
Helping the puppet is an example of a narrative goal. の プレーヤー is
motivated by emotional goals created by the ゲーム’s story, especially when
mixed with the motivation to progress a narrative forward. These are
powerful goals for humans, として storytelling and completion are deeply
woven into humanity. For many ゲーム, just これ goal motivation is enough
to invest time and effort into a full story with (expensive) cinematics. Core
gameplay drives players forward, and progression keeps them wanting
more, but deep engagement requires some emotional investment.
Other goals like “relax” suggest それ the プレーヤー may have goals for
playing the ゲーム それ are outside the structure of the ゲーム. の ゲーム
doesn’t directly have a relax button, and none of the explosions それ occur
when candies match are directly designed to ensure プレーヤー relaxation.
Relaxation is the reason the プレーヤー comes to the ゲーム, not something the
ゲーム directly produces. When all the parts of the ゲーム are working
correctly, これ goal will be the result. These sorts of goals are important to
look for and understand in your ゲーム. Just because they’re not entirely
driven by ゲーム features doesn’t mean それ あなた として a ゲーム designer できる’t
influence them. Understanding what your players want inside and outside
the ゲーム is critical.

Player-Generated Goals
One type of goal それ doesn’t show up in the goal list is プレーヤー-generated
goals. の list focuses on goals それ the ゲーム creates and enforces, but
humans love to generate and track goals on their own. Every time あなた
generate a to-do list and mentally check off items として they’re completed,
あなた’re acting として your own ゲーム designer to structure and motivate daily
life. Players do これ during ゲーム, too. In あめ Crush, players might strive
to clear a certain area or create a certain combo even if the ゲーム doesn’t
ask them to. This is good.
As a ゲーム designer, あなた できる’t force players to make their own goals. But
あなた できる create an environment where goals are easy to make and track and
enjoy. の more freedom the ゲーム gives the プレーヤー to try divergent actions,
the more players are going to find them and enjoy them. Players like
interacting with everything in the ゲーム world, which is something most
ゲーム designs should encourage. Finding ways to give strong feedback
during these actions helps the プレーヤー know それ their actions matter and それ
the ゲーム recognizes what they did. When I was working on Paperboy 64
(1999) (my first full ゲーム design), we made sure それ almost everything
reacted when being hit by a newspaper. の プレーヤー was only meant to target
a few specific things, but the world is much more fun and engaging if
everything reacts. And if a プレーヤー wants to focus on throwing papers at dogs
to keep them away from cats, they できる do それ. They don’t earn points for it,
but the ゲーム still creates these little scenarios with emotional potential and
shows the プレーヤー それ their actions have consequences.
Player-generated goals are also an important driver for gameplay goals.
During early playtests, keep an eye out for things players try to do. Ask
players what their goal is. If players want to do something, the ゲーム should
recognize and reward it. In some cases, take those personal goals and make

them into gameplay goals. But if それ’s not appropriate, take those personal
goals and acknowledge それ they matter. Keep track of them in the design to
make sure they remain fun として the ゲーム changes and iterates. If possible,
track them and give the プレーヤー a small thumbs up in-ゲーム when they
complete それ goal, even if it’s unrelated to the main goal. Players like a pat
on the back, so give them として much feedback として あなた できる to make それ
happen.

Events
Since launch, あめ Crush Saga has been finding ways to push the プレーヤー’s
ability to complete goals even further. One of the most successful features
in many free-to-play ゲーム is the event. For example, in あめ Crush
Saga, they might have a special race where the プレーヤー is rewarded for
completing a certain number of levels before other players do. In the current
builds of あめ Crush Saga, some of these “events” have become
important enough to bake back into the main ゲーム progression cycle. They
started として special events それ only appeared occasionally but now are just
something それ happens naturally during play.
There are a lot of good psychological hooks built into limited-time
events.
Players love getting more things “for free”.
They encourage coming back soon, so あなた できる complete the goal
before the event ends.
They feel special and often emphasize the unique never-before-seen
qualities of これ event.
If the goals are set up right, they scratch competitive urges in a way
それ doesn’t automatically advantage expert players.

In あめ Crush Saga, events are a great way to add an intermediate layer of
goals. あめ Crush Saga does a great job of providing immediate goals,
and the Saga Map provides a great long-term goal. But the long-term of the
Saga Map できる be pretty far off, especially now それ there are thousands and
thousands of levels. の motivation to reach the end of the map now takes
multiple years to complete. So, there’s a need for more checkboxes between
the “complete a level” box and the “beat the ゲーム” box.
Events provide a goal それ is bigger than a single level but is still realistic
to actually complete. A プレーヤー may never reach level 20,000, but they できる
earn the free powerup by collecting a few more levels to win the race. It
doesn’t even matter if they want a free powerup – it will still motivate them
to push forward just to check the box. Humans are weird それ way.
Being able to see これ in retrospect is a sign of a reasonably skilled
designer. But the real trick is identifying これ before the feature is
implemented. A really talented ゲーム designer would be able to look at
あめ Crush Saga at launch and identify the goal layers. A really really
talented ゲーム designer would be able to do それ, and then notice それ the
goal layers are fairly far apart. Even with only 80 levels, the motivation to
complete a level and the motivation to complete the ゲーム have a big gap.
And it takes a really really really talented ゲーム designer to do all それ, and
then design the right solution to fix それ problem while also fixing a few
other problems along the way. I never worked at King, so I don’t know who
came up with the idea to add the events. But they deserve a raise.
(I’d be willing to guess it wasn’t a single person sitting down doing これ
analysis and going “Aha!”. It was almost certainly a joint effort by many
people who fed each other small good ideas and then tested and iterated on
those ideas to find the best ones. Someone along the way probably noticed
the goal structures and might have advocated strongly for certain ideas

based on it, but in ゲーム good things rarely happen because of one
moment. Games are made by teams, and good ゲーム are made by
iteration.)
