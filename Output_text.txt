an impossible challenge can なれ a positive type の 欲求不満 (cough
Elden Ring cough), but not for all players. Some players want more
manageable challenges そして find extreme difficulty に なれ bad
欲求不満. But the inverse は also true – a プレーヤー who enjoys mastering
a skill may consider a sequence の easy challenges に なれ frustrating in
a very different way. Finding the right balance for the audience の your
game can なれ difficult – more on that later.
Fun Frustration: Finally, in some cases, players have agency,
understand the consequences の their actions, そして still fail. This は
called gameplay. If the プレーヤー understands why they failed, the
欲求不満 from the failure は much less. In the best cases, 欲求不満 は
a fuel that drives the プレーヤー に come back そして try again. Games are
built on iteration, both as a development practice そして as a プレーヤー
strategy. A good game will create positive feelings の 欲求不満 that
guide the プレーヤー に an emotional response along the lines の “I can do
better”. Which は a great lesson に learn for life, even outside の the
magic circle.
