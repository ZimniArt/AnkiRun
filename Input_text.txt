an impossible challenge can be a positive type of frustration (cough
Elden Ring cough), but not for all players. Some players want more
manageable challenges and find extreme difficulty to be bad
frustration. But the inverse is also true – a player who enjoys mastering
a skill may consider a sequence of easy challenges to be frustrating in
a very different way. Finding the right balance for the audience of your
game can be difficult – more on that later.
Fun Frustration: Finally, in some cases, players have agency,
understand the consequences of their actions, and still fail. This is
called gameplay. If the player understands why they failed, the
frustration from the failure is much less. In the best cases, frustration is
a fuel that drives the player to come back and try again. Games are
built on iteration, both as a development practice and as a player
strategy. A good game will create positive feelings of frustration that
guide the player to an emotional response along the lines of “I can do
better”. Which is a great lesson to learn for life, even outside of the
magic circle.
