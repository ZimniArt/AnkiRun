Outside Frustration: If the player has no agency, then it’s outside
frustration. It can be annoying, but it’s less personal so thus less

impactful. I can get frustrated watching a communication problem
unfold in an episode of a sitcom, but I don’t feel it personally.
Uncontrolled Frustration: Once the player has control of the action,
the potential for emotional involvement is higher. Give me buttons to
press and now any failure is my fault. So, the worst case here is when
the player has input but no real control. If the player expects to have
control but loses due to reasons outside of their control, that can be
very frustrating. The game made a promise and then failed to deliver.
This is often the worst form of frustration and game designer should be
careful to avoid situations like this. If the player needs to fail
regardless of their actions, make it very clear that the game knows it’s
not the player’s fault.
Confused Frustration: If the player has agency that actually matters,
that’s going to reduce the negative impact of the frustration. But this is
only true if the player understands all that. If the player doesn’t
understand how their actions influence the outcome, they might as well
not have agency. This is where many games fall apart, especially for
more casual audiences. It’s very frustrating to press buttons and not
understand why they matter. And that understanding is entirely the
responsibility of the game designer. Remember, the player only knows
what comes through that tiny funnel of information they see on the
pixels on the screen. If they aren’t able to construct a full mental model
of the logic going on inside the computer, to expect, they’re going to
have some negative frustration. In many cases, the hard part of being a
game designer isn’t coming up with good ideas; it’s getting the player
to understand those good ideas.
Difficult Frustration: Agency that matters and makes sense is not
enough. The challenges also have to be fair. Banging your head against

an impossible challenge can be a positive type of frustration (cough
Elden Ring cough), but not for all players. Some players want more
manageable challenges and find extreme difficulty to be bad
frustration. But the inverse is also true – a player who enjoys mastering
a skill may consider a sequence of easy challenges to be frustrating in
a very different way. Finding the right balance for the audience of your
game can be difficult – more on that later.
Fun Frustration: Finally, in some cases, players have agency,
understand the consequences of their actions, and still fail. This is
called gameplay. If the player understands why they failed, the
frustration from the failure is much less. In the best cases, frustration is
a fuel that drives the player to come back and try again. Games are
built on iteration, both as a development practice and as a player
strategy. A good game will create positive feelings of frustration that
guide the player to an emotional response along the lines of “I can do
better”. Which is a great lesson to learn for life, even outside of the
magic circle.

Meaning
I think it’s important to understand what games mean. Since games are a
relatively new form of art, we don’t always think of them as having an
impact on the world. But they do. The person who starts playing a game is
different from the person after the game is done. Games make people think
about things. Games change the world.
For many games, this is not the primary goal of the game. It might be
money. It might be providing a simple fun time. But meaning happens
whether the creator intends it or not. I understand programming better
because I played Robo-Rally. Some of my love of creativity and creative

problem-solving comes from early Infocom text adventures. Minecraft has
made a generation of kids think differently about creation and resources and
exploration and problem-solving.
I don’t think any game has one discrete meaning. Even games with a
clear intended meaning will be interpreted differently by each player who
encounters it. So, when I talk about meaning in the games in this book, I
don’t intend to exclude other meanings. When we talk about this in class,
every semester has different answers and they’re all right.
For me, Shovel Knight is about persistence. It’s not the only game where
the main character is beaten down constantly and has to constantly get up,
but it’s a clear example of that style of play. I’m not the most skilled player,
so I tend to die a lot. But the only time I feel like I’m losing is when I put
the game away and give up on saving poor Shield Knight.
