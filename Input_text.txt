strategies are not the only type of dynamics. Any combination of rules that
leads to a new result counts.
When a game is described as “elegant”, that usually means that it takes
a relatively small set of rules and builds a lot of interesting dynamics
around those rules. The rules of Go are (basically) “On your turn, place
a stone of your color on a 19x19 grid. If a group of stones is
surrounded, it is removed. Whoever has the most stones wins”. But
this foundation leads to a lot of other dynamics.
You can build enemy AI out of very simple rules that result in a
behavior that feels complex. For example, if you want a group of AIcontrolled characters to move as a group, you can get very compelling
flocking behavior out of a few simple pointers that each entity
interprets on its own. Flocking is a dynamic.
The combat in Halo has a certain feel. It’s fast-paced but with an
interesting back and forth based on weapon types and distances. These
are not written in the rules or the code but are a consequence of the
code. The “feel” of the game is another important type of dynamic.
Talking about dynamics is a way to understand how different rules fit
together to make something bigger. It’s a way to read between the lines and
see the underlying systems that are built out of the individual rules.
Dynamics are important because the dynamic is often the target that the
game designer is trying to hit. Game designers don’t strive to make a game
with 0.7 seconds between sniper rifle shots (see the 2010 GDC talk by
Jaime Griesemer “Design in Detail: Changing the Time Between Shots for
the Sniper Rifle from 0.5 to 0.7 seconds for Halo 3”), they strive to make
combat feel fast-paced with an interesting back and forth, combat that feels
different every time because of different abilities that combine to create new
